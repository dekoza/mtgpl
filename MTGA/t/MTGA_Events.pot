"We asked Yargle how best to celebrate, and here's how we interpreted its gurgles and shrieks:\n"
"- Yargle makes the rules! Yargle has provided decks for everyone to use, and we've even cleaned most of the slime off of them.\n"
"- Yargle is the center of attention! Yargle is the only non-common card allowed, and you'll have plenty of extras so you won't run out.\n"
"- Yargle is special! Yargle will be faster to get into the fight, so nobody has to have fun alone.\n"
"\n"
"Join us for a rip-roaring good time with a spirit of a frog which ate a maggot that was actually a transformed lieutenant of a demon. Happy Yargle Day, everyone!"

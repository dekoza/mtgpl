<h2>Ignite Your Spark<a class="headerlink" href="#ignite-your-spark" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the <strong>Magic™</strong> game, you are counted among the elite spellcasters of the Multiverse — the Planeswalkers.
Some are friends and others are foes. All wield terrifying magic and command armies of creatures torn from the endless planes of reality.
Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.
Customize your own <strong>Magic</strong> deck, then challenge your friends to see whose spark burns the brightest!</p>
<p>Trading card games like the <strong>Magic: The Gathering®</strong> game combine collectable cards with a strategy game.
Start your collection with an intro pack and begin battling immediately with a ready-to-play deck.</p>
<p>Once you’ve gotten a handle on how to play, customize your deck using cards from booster packs, starting with the ones included in your intro pack.
You don’t know what cards you’ll get in a <strong>Magic</strong> booster pack. You just start a collection and trade with other players to get the cards you want.
You can find stores where <strong>Magic</strong> cards are sold at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizards.com/Locator/">Wizards.com/Locator</a>.</p>
<p>The best part about a trading card game is that it’s always changing. You design and build your own unique decks, and each <strong>Magic</strong> game you play is different.
New <strong>Magic</strong> expansions are released a few times a year, and each new expansion brings new ways to stupefy and defeat your opponents.
Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://magicthegathering.com/">MagicTheGathering.com</a> for daily articles, insider information, and news about upcoming sets!</p>

<h2>Section 1: The Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1-the-basics" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> game is a strategy game played by two or more players, each of whom has a customized deck of <strong>Magic</strong> cards.
Over the course of the game, each player will take turns playing cards such as lands (which enable you to play your other cards), creatures,
sorceries, and other spells. Each player starts at 20 life. When you reduce your opponent to 0 life by attacking with creatures and playing
spells, you win!</p>
<div class="section" id="five-colors-of-mana">
<h3>Five Colors of Mana<a class="headerlink" href="#five-colors-of-mana" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>Only one thing unites the infinite planes of the Multiverse: mana, the energy that fuels all magic. The five colors of mana are imbued
in the land itself, and a Planeswalker with a connection to a place can call upon its mana from across the sea of Æther between worlds.</p>
<p>Each color of mana fuels a different kind of powerful magic for you to command. For example, red spells have <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> in their costs,
and tapping (turning) a Mountain gives you <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> that you can spend to cast spells. It’s up to you whether to master one color or all five.</p>
<img alt="_images/star_seating.jpg" class="align-right" src="_images/star_seating.jpg" />
<div class="section" id="white">
<h4>White<a class="headerlink" href="#white" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p><strong>White</strong> is the color of law, order, and structure. The sprawling <strong>Plains</strong>,
populated by soldiers, clerics, and angels, provide white mana. You send
coordinated armies of smaller creatures into battle to teach the enemy a lesson.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="green">
<h4>Green<a class="headerlink" href="#green" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p><strong>Green</strong> magic is about growth, life, and brute force. The <strong>Forests</strong> overflow with
green mana, which represents the pulse of nature. You empower your creatures
with the predatory might of nature and dominate through sheer size.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blue">
<h4>Blue<a class="headerlink" href="#blue" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p><strong>Blue</strong> magic relies on trickery and manipulation. <strong>Islands</strong> provide blue
mana, the color of the deep sea and the endless sky. You work behind the
scenes, controlling your environment completely before making a move.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="red">
<h4>Red<a class="headerlink" href="#red" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p><strong>Red</strong> magic erupts with fire, frenzy, and storms of rock and lava. Red mana comes
from <strong>Mountains</strong> and volcanoes. You act quickly and recklessly, channeling
your wild emotions to summon mighty dragons or crush the ground your
enemies walk on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="black">
<h4>Black<a class="headerlink" href="#black" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p><strong>Black</strong> magic is about death, disease, and power at any cost. Black mana comes
from dank <strong>Swamps</strong>, where things fester and rot. You are as selfish and twisted as
the undead creatures and unspeakable horrors you command.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parts-of-a-card">
<span id="sec-parts-of-a-card"></span><h3>Parts of a Card<a class="headerlink" href="#parts-of-a-card" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<img alt="_images/parts_of_card.png" class="align-center" src="_images/parts_of_card.png" />
<div class="section" id="mana-cost">
<h4>Mana Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#mana-cost" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#term-mana"><span class="xref std std-term">Mana</span></a> is the main resource in the game. It’s produced by lands, and you spend it to cast <em>spells</em>.
The symbols in a card’s upper right corner tell you the cost to cast that spell. If the mana cost reads
<img alt="{4}" src="_images/mana_4.png" /> <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" />, you pay four mana of any kinds plus two red mana (from two Mountains) to cast it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="type-line">
<h4>Type Line<a class="headerlink" href="#type-line" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>This tells you the card’s <a class="reference internal" href="#term-card-type"><span class="xref std std-term">card type</span></a>: artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land,
planeswalker, or sorcery. If the card has a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-subtype"><span class="xref std std-term">subtype</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="#term-supertype"><span class="xref std std-term">supertype</span></a>, that’s also listed
here. For example, Shivan Dragon is a creature, and its subtype is the creature
type Dragon.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expansion-symbol">
<h4>Expansion Symbol<a class="headerlink" href="#expansion-symbol" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>This symbol tells you which <strong>Magic</strong> set the card is from. This version of Shivan
Dragon is from the <em>Magic 2014</em> core set. The color of the symbol tells you the
card’s rarity: black for common cards, silver for uncommons, gold for rares, and
red-orange for mythic rares.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="text-box">
<h4>Text Box<a class="headerlink" href="#text-box" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>This is where a card’s <em>abilities</em> appear. You may also find flavor text printed in italics
(like this) that tells you something about the Magic world. Flavor text has no effect
on game play. Some abilities have italic reminder text to help explain what they do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="power-and-toughness">
<h4>Power and Toughness<a class="headerlink" href="#power-and-toughness" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>Each creature card has a special box with its <a class="reference internal" href="#term-power"><span class="xref std std-term">power</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-toughness"><span class="xref std std-term">toughness</span></a>. A creature’s power
(the first number) is how much damage it deals in combat. Its toughness (the second number)
is how much damage must be dealt to it in a single turn to destroy it. (A planeswalker
card has a different special box with its loyalty here.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="collector-number">
<h4>Collector Number<a class="headerlink" href="#collector-number" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>The collector number makes it easier to organize
your cards. For example, „154/249” means that the
card is the 154th of 249 cards in its set.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="card-types">
<h3>Card Types<a class="headerlink" href="#card-types" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>Every <strong>Magic</strong> card has one or more types. A card’s type tells you when you can play the card and what
happens to the card after you do.</p>
<div class="section" id="sorcery">
<span id="sec-sorcery"></span><h4>Sorcery<a class="headerlink" href="#sorcery" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>A sorcery represents a magical incantation. You can cast a sorcery only during
a <em>main phase</em> of one of your own turns. You can’t cast it when another spell is
on the <em>stack</em>. (You’ll learn about phases and the stack in a bit.) A sorcery has
its <em>effect</em>—in other words, you follow the instructions on the card—then you put
it into your <em>graveyard</em>, which is the game term for your discard pile.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="instant">
<span id="sec-instant"></span><h4>Instant<a class="headerlink" href="#instant" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>An instant is just like a sorcery, except you can cast it just about any time
you want, even during your opponent’s turn or <em>in response</em> to another spell.
Like a sorcery, an instant has its effect, then you put it into your graveyard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enchantment">
<span id="sec-enchantment"></span><h4>Enchantment<a class="headerlink" href="#enchantment" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>An enchantment represents a stable magical manifestation. An enchantment is
a <em>permanent</em>. This means two things: you can cast one only at the time you
could cast a sorcery, and after you cast one, you’ll put it on the table
in front of you, near your lands. (Most players keep their lands closer to them,
then put their other cards closer to the middle of the table.) The card is now
on the <em>battlefield</em>. A card on the battlefield is called a <em>permanent</em> because it
sticks around permanently (well, unless something destroys it).</p>
<p>Some enchantments are <em>Auras</em>. An Aura enters the battlefield attached to
a permanent and affects that permanent while it’s on the battlefield. If the
enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield, the Aura is put into its owner’s
graveyard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="artifact">
<span id="sec-artifact"></span><h4>Artifact<a class="headerlink" href="#artifact" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>An artifact represents a magical relic. Like an enchantment, an artifact is a permanent, so it’ll stay on the
battlefield affecting the game. Most artifacts are colorless, so you can cast one no matter what kinds of lands
you have.</p>
<p>Some artifacts are <em>Equipment</em>. You can pay to attach an Equipment to a creature you control to make that
creature more powerful. If an equipped creature leaves the battlefield, the Equipment doesn’t—the creature
drops it and it remains on the battlefield.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creature">
<span id="sec-creature"></span><h4>Creature<a class="headerlink" href="#creature" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>Creatures fight for you. They’re permanents, but unlike any other kind of permanent, creatures can <em>attack</em>
and <em>block</em>. Each creature has <em>power</em> and <em>toughness</em>. Its power (the first number) is how much <em>damage</em> it deals
in combat. Its toughness (the second number) is how much damage must be dealt to it in a single turn to
destroy it. Creatures attack and block during the <em>combat phase</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike other types of permanents, creatures enter the battlefield with „summoning sickness”: a creature
can’t attack, or use an ability that has <img alt="{T}" src="_images/tap.png" /> in its cost, until it has started your turn on the battlefield under
your control. You can block with a creature or activate its other abilities no matter how long it’s been on
the battlefield.</p>
<p>Artifact creatures are both artifacts and creatures. They’re usually colorless like other artifacts, and they
can attack and block like other creatures. An artifact creature can be affected by anything that affects
artifacts, as well as anything that affects creatures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="planeswalker">
<span id="sec-planeswalker"></span><h4>Planeswalker<a class="headerlink" href="#planeswalker" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>Planeswalkers are powerful allies you can call on to fight by your side. You can cast a planeswalker only at the
time you could cast a sorcery. They’re permanents, and each one enters the battlefield with the number of
<em>loyalty</em> counters indicated in its lower right corner.</p>
<p>Each planeswalker has <em>loyalty abilities</em> that are activated by adding or removing loyalty counters from the
planeswalker. For example, the symbol {+1} means „Put one loyalty counter on this planeswalker” and the symbol
{-3} means „Remove three loyalty counters from this planeswalker.” You can activate one of these abilities only
at the time you could cast a sorcery and only if none of that planeswalker’s loyalty abilities have been activated
yet that turn.</p>
<p>Your planeswalkers can be attacked by your opponent’s creatures (if so, you can block as normal), and
your opponents can damage them with their spells and abilities instead of damaging you. Any damage dealt
to a planeswalker causes it to lose that many loyalty counters. If a planeswalker has no loyalty counters, it’s
put into your graveyard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="land">
<span id="sec-land"></span><h4>Land<a class="headerlink" href="#land" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>Although lands are permanents, they aren’t cast as spells. To play a land, just put it onto the battlefield. This
happens immediately, so no player can do anything else in response. You can play a land only during one
of your main phases while the stack is empty. You can’t play more than one land a turn.</p>
<p>Most lands have abilities that make mana. You’ll use lands to make the mana you need to pay for spells
and abilities.</p>
<p>Each basic land has a mana ability that makes one mana of a particular color. Plains make white mana
(<img alt="{W}" src="_images/mana_w.png" />), Islands make blue mana (<img alt="{U}" src="_images/mana_u.png" />), Swamps make black mana (<img alt="{B}" src="_images/mana_b.png" />), Mountains make red mana (<img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" />), and
Forests make green mana (<img alt="{G}" src="_images/mana_g.png" />). Any land other than these five is a <em>nonbasic land</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="game-zones">
<h3>Game Zones<a class="headerlink" href="#game-zones" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since the Magic game doesn’t have a game board,
zones are the areas of play that exist on your table.</p>
<div class="section" id="library">
<span id="sec-library"></span><h4>Library<a class="headerlink" href="#library" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>When the game begins, your deck of cards becomes your library (your draw
pile). It’s kept face down, and the cards stay in the order they were in at the
beginning of the game. No one can look at the cards in your library, but you
can know how many cards are in each player’s library. Each player has his or
her own library.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hand">
<span id="sec-hand"></span><h4>Hand<a class="headerlink" href="#hand" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>When you draw cards, they go to your hand, just as in most other card games.
No one except you can look at the cards in your hand. You start the game with
seven cards in your hand, and you have a maximum hand size of seven. (You
may have more than seven cards in your hand, but you must discard down to
seven at the end of each of your turns.) Each player has his or her own hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-stack">
<span id="sec-the-stack"></span><h4>The Stack<a class="headerlink" href="#the-stack" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>Spells and abilities exist on the stack. They wait there to <em>resolve</em> until both
players choose not to cast any new spells or activate any new abilities. Then the
last spell or ability that was put onto the stack resolves, and players get a chance
to cast spells and activate abilities again. (You’ll learn more about casting spells
and activating abilities in the next section.) This zone is shared by both players.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="battlefield">
<span id="sec-battlefield"></span><h4>Battlefield<a class="headerlink" href="#battlefield" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>You start the game with nothing on the battlefield, but this is where the action
is going to be. On each of your turns, you can play a land from your hand.
Creatures, artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers also enter the battlefield
after they resolve. You can arrange your permanents however you want (we
recommend putting lands closest to you), but your opponent must be able to see
all of them and tell whether they’re <em>tapped</em>. This zone is shared by both players.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graveyard">
<span id="sec-graveyard"></span><h4>Graveyard<a class="headerlink" href="#graveyard" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>Your graveyard is your discard pile. Your instant and sorcery spells go to your
graveyard when they resolve. Your cards go to your graveyard if an effect causes
them to be <em>discarded</em>, <em>destroyed</em>, <em>sacrificed</em>, or <em>countered</em>. Your planeswalkers go
to your graveyard if they lose all their loyalty counters. Your creatures go to
your graveyard if the damage they’re dealt in a single turn is equal to or greater
than their toughness, or if their toughness is reduced to 0 or less. Cards in your
graveyard are always face up and anyone can look at them at any time. Each
player has his or her own graveyard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exile">
<span id="sec-exile"></span><h4>Exile<a class="headerlink" href="#exile" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>If a spell or ability <em>exiles</em> a card, that card is put in a game area that’s set apart
from the rest of the game. The card will remain there forever, unless whatever
put it there is able to bring it back. Exiled cards are normally face up. This zone
is shared by both players.</p>
<p>Here’s what a game in progress looks like. In this
example, there aren’t any exiled cards, and no spells
are on the stack. (When you put a spell on the stack,
you take the card from your hand and put it in the
middle of the table until it finishes resolving.)</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section-2-the-building-blocks">
<h2>Section 2: The Building Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#section-2-the-building-blocks" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section describes the actions that you’ll take during a game. You’ll learn how to
make mana, which is the resource you need to cast spells. You’ll learn how to cast a spell,
as well as how to use abilities. You’ll also learn how to attack and block with your creatures.
The section finisheswith a brief description of how to build your first deck and an explanation
of the game’s <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-golden-rule"><span class="std std-ref">Golden Rule</span></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="making-mana">
<h3>Making Mana<a class="headerlink" href="#making-mana" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>To do just about anything else in the game, you first need to be
able to make mana. Think of mana as Magic money—it’s what
you use to pay most costs. Each mana is either one of the five
<strong>Magic</strong> <em>colors</em> or is <a class="reference internal" href="#term-colorless"><span class="xref std std-term">colorless</span></a>. When a cost requires colored mana,
you’ll see colored mana symbols (<img alt="{W}" src="_images/mana_w.png" /> for white, <img alt="{U}" src="_images/mana_u.png" /> for blue, <img alt="{B}" src="_images/mana_b.png" />
for black, <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> for red, <img alt="{G}" src="_images/mana_g.png" /> for green). When any kind of mana
can be used to pay the cost, you’ll see a symbol with a number
in it (like <img alt="{2}" src="_images/mana_2.png" />).</p>
<p>Where does mana come from? Nearly every land in the game
has an ability that produces mana. Basic lands just have a large
mana symbol in their text boxes to show this—you can tap one
of them to add one mana of that color to your <a class="reference internal" href="#term-mana-pool"><span class="xref std std-term">mana pool</span></a>. (Your
mana pool is where mana is stored until you spend it.) Other
lands, as well as some creatures, artifacts, and spells, may also
make mana. They’ll say something like „Add <img alt="{G}" src="_images/mana_g.png" /> to your mana
pool.”</p>

<p>Mana that you’ve made doesn’t last forever. At the end of each
step or phase of the turn, any unused mana in your mana pool
disappears. This doesn’t happen often because usually you’ll only
make mana when you need it to cast a spell or activate an ability.</p>
<div class="section" id="tapping">
<span id="sec-tapping"></span><h4>Tapping<a class="headerlink" href="#tapping" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>To tap a card is to turn it sideways. You do this when you use a land to make mana,
when you attack with a creature, or when you activate an ability that has the <img alt="{T}" src="_images/tap.png" />
symbol as part of its cost (<img alt="{T}" src="_images/tap.png" /> means „tap this permanent”).</p>
<p>When a permanent is tapped, that usually means it’s been used for the turn. You
can’t tap it again until it’s been <em>untapped</em> (straightened out).</p>
<p>At the beginning of each of your turns, you untap your tapped cards so you can
use them again.</p>

<div class="section" id="spells">
<span id="sec-spells"></span><h3>Spells<a class="headerlink" href="#spells" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now that you can make mana, you’ll want to use it to cast spells. All cards except
lands are cast as spells. You can cast sorceries, creatures, artifacts, enchantments,
and planeswalkers only during one of your main phases when there’s nothing else on the stack.
Instants can be cast at any time.</p>
<div class="section" id="casting-a-spell">
<h4>Casting a Spell<a class="headerlink" href="#casting-a-spell" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>To cast a spell, take the card you want to cast from your hand, show
it to your opponent, and put it on the stack. (The stack is the game
zone where spells live. It’s usually in the middle of the table.)</p>
<p>There are a few choices that you need to make right now. If the
spell is an instant or sorcery and says „Choose one —,” you choose
which of the options you’re using. If the spell is an instant or sorcery
and it has a target, you choose what (or who) that target is. Aura
spells also target the permanents they’ll enchant. If the spell has <img alt="{X}" src="_images/mana_x.png" /> in
its cost, you choose what number X stands for. Other choices will be
made later, when the spell resolves.</p>
<p>Now check what the spell’s cost is. Tap your lands to produce
the mana necessary to pay that cost, and pay it. Once you do that,
the spell has been cast.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="target">
<span id="sec-target"></span><h4>Target<a class="headerlink" href="#target" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>When you see the word „target” on a spell or ability, you have to
choose one or more things for the spell or ability to affect.
You’ll be able to choose only certain kinds of things, such
as „target enchantment” or „target creature or player.”</p>
<p>You choose the targets for a
spell when you cast it, and you choose targets for an
activated ability when you activate it. If you can’t meet
the targeting requirements, you can’t cast the spell or
activate the activated ability. Once you choose targets,
you can’t change your mind later.</p>
<p>When the spell or ability resolves, it checks the
targets to make sure they’re still <em>legal</em> (they’re still there,
and they match the requirements stated by the spell or
ability). If a target isn’t legal, the spell or ability can’t
affect it. If none of the targets are legal, the spell or
ability is countered and does nothing at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="responding-to-a-spell">
<span id="sec-responding-to-a-spell"></span><h4>Responding to a Spell<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-a-spell" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>The spell doesn’t resolve (have its effect) right away—it has to wait
on the stack. Each player, including you, now gets a chance to cast
an instant or activate an activated ability <em>in response</em>. If a player
does, that instant or ability goes on the stack on top of what was
already waiting there. When all players decline to do anything, the
top spell or ability on the stack will resolve.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resolving-a-spell">
<span id="sec-resolving-a-spell"></span><h4>Resolving a Spell<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-a-spell" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>When a spell resolves, one of two things happens. If the spell
is an instant or sorcery, it has its effect (in other words, you
follow the instructions on the card), then you put the card into
your graveyard. If the spell is a creature, artifact, enchantment,
or planeswalker, you put the card on the table in front of you,
near your lands. The card is now on the battlefield. Any of your
cards on the battlefield is called a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-permanent"><span class="xref std std-term">permanent</span></a> because it sticks
around permanently (well, until something happens to it). Many
permanents have abilities, which is text on them that affects the
game.</p>
<p>After a spell or ability resolves, both players get the chance to
play something new. If no one does, the next thing waiting on
the stack will resolve (or if the stack is empty, the current part of
the turn will end and the game will proceed to the next part). If
either player plays something new, it goes on top of the stack and
the process repeats.</p>

<li>You and your opponent both decline to do
anything else. Show of Valor resolves, making
the Auramancer 4/6 until the end of the turn.</li>
<li>Then the Shock resolves, dealing 2 damage
to the pumped-up Auramancer. That’s not
enough to destroy it.</li>
</ol>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>What would happen if the Show of Valor were cast first?</strong></p>
<p>The Shock goes on the stack on top of
Show of Valor so it resolves first. It deals 2

it! When the Show of Valor tries to resolve,
its only target is no longer on the battlefield,

<div class="section" id="abilities">
<span id="sec-abilities"></span><h3>Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#abilities" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>As you start to accumulate permanents on the battlefield, the game will change. That’s because many
permanents have text on them that affects the game. This text tells you a permanent’s abilities. There
are three different kinds of abilities a permanent can have: <em>static abilities</em>, <em>triggered abilities</em>,
and <em>activated abilities</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="static-abilities">
<span id="sec-static-abilities"></span><h4>Static Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#static-abilities" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>A static ability is text that is always true while that card is on the battlefield. For example, Imposing
Sovereign is a creature with the ability „Creatures your opponents control enter the battlefield tapped.”
You don’t activate a static ability. It just does what it says.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="triggered-abilities">
<span id="sec-triggered-abilities"></span><h4>Triggered Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#triggered-abilities" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>A triggered ability is text that happens when a specific event occurs in the game. For example, Messenger
Drake is a creature with the ability „When Messenger Drake dies, draw a card.”</p>
<p>Each triggered ability starts with the word „when,” „whenever,” or „at.” You don’t activate a triggered
ability. It automatically triggers whenever the first part of the ability happens. The ability goes on the
stack just like a spell, and resolves just like a spell. If the ability triggers but then the permanent the
ability came from leaves the battlefield, the ability will still resolve.</p>
<p>You can’t choose to delay or ignore a triggered ability. However, if the ability targets something or
someone but you can’t choose a legal target for it, the ability won’t do anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="activated-abilities">
<span id="sec-activated-abilities"></span><h4>Activated Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#activated-abilities" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>An activated ability is an ability that you can activate whenever you want, as long as you can pay the
cost. For example, Blood Bairn is a creature with the ability „Sacrifice another creature: Blood Bairn
gets +2/+2 until end of turn.”</p>
<p>Each activated ability has a cost, then a colon („:”), then an effect. Activating one works exactly like
casting an instant spell, except there’s no card to put on the stack. The ability goes on the stack just like
a spell, and resolves just like a spell. If you activate an ability but then the permanent the ability came
from leaves the battlefield, the ability will still resolve.</p>
<p>Some activated abilities contain the <img alt="{T}" src="_images/tap.png" /> symbol in their costs. This means that you must tap the
permanent to activate the ability. You can’t activate the ability if the permanent is already tapped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keywords">
<h4>Keywords<a class="headerlink" href="#keywords" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>Some permanents have abilities that are shortened to a single word or phrase. Many of these have
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-reminder-text"><span class="xref std std-term">reminder text</span></a> that gives you a brief description of the ability’s effect.
Keyword abilities in the core set include <a class="reference internal" href="#term-deathtouch"><span class="xref std std-term">deathtouch</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#term-defender"><span class="xref std std-term">defender</span></a>,

Most of these are static abilities, but keyword abilities can also be triggered abilities or activated abilities.

<div class="section" id="attacking-and-blocking">
<span id="sec-attacking-and-blocking"></span><h3>Attacking and Blocking<a class="headerlink" href="#attacking-and-blocking" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>The primary way to win the game is to attack with your creatures. If a creature that’s attacking your opponent isn’t
blocked, it deals damage equal to its power to him or her. It doesn’t take that many hits to drop your opponent all the
way from 20 life to 0!</p>
<p>The middle of each turn is the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-combat-phase"><span class="xref std std-term">combat phase</span></a>. (You’ll learn about the <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-parts-of-the-turn"><span class="std std-ref">parts of the turn</span></a>
in a bit.) In your combat phase, you choose which of your creatures will attack, and you choose who or what they will
attack. Each one can attack your opponent or one of your opponent’s planeswalkers, but not any of his or her creatures.
You tap the attacking creatures. They all attack at the same time, even if they’re attacking different things.
You can attack with a creature only if it’s untapped, and only if it was on the battlefield under your control
when the turn began.</p>
<p>Your opponent chooses which of his or her creatures will block. Tapped creatures can’t be declared as blockers. For
blocking, it doesn’t matter how long the creature has been on the battlefield. Each creature can block only one attacker,
but multiple blockers can gang up on a single attacking creature. If that happens, the attacking player orders
the blockers to show which is first in line for damage, which is second, and so on. Creatures don’t have to block.</p>
<p>After all blockers are chosen, combat damage is assigned. Each creature—both attackers and
blockers—deals damage equal to its power.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An attacking creature that isn’t blocked
deals damage to the player or planeswalker it’s
attacking.</li>
<li>An attacking creature that is blocked deals damage to
the blocking creatures. If one of your attacking creatures
is blocked by multiple creatures, you decide how to divide
its combat damage among them. You must assign at least
enough damage to the first blocking creature in line to
destroy it before you can assign damage to the next one
in line, and so on.</li>
<li>A blocking creature deals damage to the attacker it’s
blocking.</li>
</ul>
<p>If damage is dealt to your opponent, he or she loses that much life!</p>
<p>If damage is dealt to your opponent’s planeswalker, that many loyalty counters are removed from it.</p>
<p>If a creature is dealt damage equal to or greater than its toughness over the course of a single turn, that creature
is destroyed and goes to its owner’s graveyard. If a creature takes damage that isn’t lethal, that creature stays on
the battlefield, but the damage doesn’t wear off until the turn ends.</p>

<span id="sec-building-your-own-deck"></span><h3>Building Your Own Deck<a class="headerlink" href="#building-your-own-deck" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>You play a Magic game with your own customized deck. You build it yourself using whichever Magic cards you want. There are two rules:
your deck must have at least 60 cards, and your deck can’t have more than four copies of any single card (except for basic lands). The rest
is up to you, but here are some guidelines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lands. A good rule of thumb is that 40% of your deck should be lands. A 60-card deck usually has about 24 lands.</li>
<li>Creatures. Creatures account for 15 to 25 cards in a typical 60-card deck. Choose creatures that have a variety of mana costs.</li>
<li>Low-cost creatures are potent early on, but high-cost creatures can quickly win a game once they enter the battlefield.</li>
<li>Other cards. Artifacts, enchantments, planeswalkers, instants, and sorceries round out your deck.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you play with your new deck for a while, you can start to customize it. Take out cards you don’t feel are working well and add new
cards you want to try. The best part about trading card games is being able to play with whatever cards you want, so start experimenting!</p>
<p>Once they build up their collections, Magic players often choose to build different decks for different formats. Formats are defined by
what cards can be played in them. The most popular Magic format is called Standard. It uses only the newest sets the game has to offer. The
current block, the block that was released the previous October, and the most recent core set are all legal to play in a Standard deck. Standard
events are available all year, worldwide. When you’re ready to start exploring other Magic formats, go to <a class="reference external" href="http://wizards.com/MagicFormats/">Wizards.com/MagicFormats</a> for
more information.</p>

<span id="sec-golden-rule"></span><h3>The Golden Rule<a class="headerlink" href="#the-golden-rule" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>When a Magic card contradicts the rulebook, the card wins. For example, the rules say creatures
enter the battlefield untapped. But Imposing Sovereign is a creature that says „Creatures your opponents
control enter the battlefield tapped.” Imposing Sovereign changes the rules as long as it’s on the battlefield.
One of the things that makes the Magic game fun to play is that there are individual cards that let you break
almost every rule.</p>

<p>Now that you know the elements of the game and how to perform the main actions, it’s time to walk through a turn. This section
describes what happens in each part of a turn. In a typical game, you’ll skip many of these parts (for example, nothing usually

<div class="section" id="get-a-deck">
<h3>Get a Deck<a class="headerlink" href="#get-a-deck" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>

use as counters or tokens.</p>
<p>When you’re first getting started, you may want to pick up a ready-to-play deck, such as an intro pack or event deck, or

that happen during that step or phase trigger and are put on the stack. The <em>active player</em> (the player whose turn it is) gets to cast spells and

assigns its combat damage to the defending player (if it’s attacking
that player and wasn’t blocked), to a planeswalker (if it’s attacking
that planeswalker and wasn’t blocked), to the creature or creatures
blocking it, or to the creature it’s blocking. If an attacking creature is
blocked by multiple creatures, you divide its combat damage among
them by assigning at least enough damage to the first blocking
creature in line to destroy it before assigning damage to the next
one in line, and so on. Once players decide how the creatures they
control will deal their combat damage, the damage is all dealt at the

<p>One of the fascinating aspects of the Magic game is that it changes from turn to turn—and the cards
themselves can actually alter the rules of the game. As you play, you’ll find nonland cards with abilities that
produce mana, and lands that do other things besides produce mana. You’ll find creatures with the haste
ability, which allows them to attack right away. You’ll find creatures with flying and trample, which change
the rules of combat. You’ll find cards with abilities that work from your graveyard. You’ll find cards
whose abilities work together for an effect that’s much more powerful than either one could achieve alone
(such as the combo of Tenacious Dead and Gnawing Zombie). This is a game of discovery, of amazement,
of fighting, and of tricks. This is a game of magic.</p>

many options, there are lots of different ways to play. Everyone can start on equal footing with brand-new cards rather than build decks
in advance from the cards in their collections. You can even play with a bunch of friends, not just one.</p>
<div class="section" id="limited-formats">
<span id="sec-limited-formats"></span><h3>Limited Formats<a class="headerlink" href="#limited-formats" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>In Limited play, each player builds his or her own deck on the spot out of a number of booster packs. In other words, your deck is made
from a limited card pool. Each deck must contain at least 40 cards (rather than the usual 60 for a Constructed deck). The only cards
you can play with are the ones opened in those packs, plus any number of basic land cards. (A 40-card deck should have about 17 lands
and about 15 creatures.)</p>
<div class="section" id="sealed-deck-any-number-of-players">
<h4>Sealed Deck (any number of players)<a class="headerlink" href="#sealed-deck-any-number-of-players" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>In this Limited format, you build a deck out of brand-new booster packs. Each player opens six 15-card boosters and builds a 40-card
deck using the cards from his or her packs and any number of basic lands.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="booster-draft-4-to-8-players">
<h4>Booster Draft (4 to 8 players)<a class="headerlink" href="#booster-draft-4-to-8-players" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>In this Limited format, instead of just opening your cards and building a deck, you and the other players at the table select (draft) the
cards for your decks. Each player at the table starts with three unopened 15-card booster packs.</p>
<p>At the start of a booster draft, each player opens a pack and picks the card he or she wants from it. (You can’t see the cards that the
other players draft.) Then each player passes the rest of the pack to his or her left. You pick up the pack that was passed to you, select a
card, and pass the rest to your left. This process continues until all the cards have been drafted. Next, each player opens a second pack,
but this time, you pass the pack to your right. After all those cards are drafted, you open the third pack and pass to the left again. Use
your picks and any number of basic lands to build your 40-card deck.</p>

<span id="sec-multiplayer-variants"></span><h3>Multiplayer Variants<a class="headerlink" href="#multiplayer-variants" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can play a Magic game with more than two players in it. There are dozens of different ways to do so. Some of the most popular are
Two-Headed Giant and <a class="reference internal" href="commander.html"><span class="doc">Commander</span></a>, which can be played using only traditional Magic cards from your collection. Other multiplayer
variants use oversized cards or a special die to provide a unique experience for your play group.</p>
<div class="section" id="two-headed-giant">
<h4>Two-Headed Giant<a class="headerlink" href="#two-headed-giant" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>In a Two-Headed Giant game, you and a teammate play against
another two-person team. You and your teammate can show each
other your hands and discuss strategy. Your team has a shared life
total that starts at 30, you and your teammate have a shared turn,
and your team’s creatures attack the other team as a group. But you
continue to have your own individual library, control your own
permanents, spend your own mana, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="commander">
<h4>Commander<a class="headerlink" href="#commander" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>In a Commander game, each player’s deck is led by the legendary
creature of his or her choice—fittingly, that’s the deck’s <em>commander</em>.
The rest of the deck is a specially crafted arsenal of creatures,
artifacts, and other spells, designed to reflect the personality of
that commander and take advantage of his or her strengths. A
Commander game is best enjoyed as a Free-for-All game among
3–6 players, although two-player games are also common.

<div class="section" id="planechase">
<h4>Planechase<a class="headerlink" href="#planechase" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Planechase variant adds a deck of oversized plane cards that
set the location for your multiplayer battles across the Multiverse.
The planes have abilities that alter the rules of the game. If you
don’t like your current surroundings, you can try to planeswalk by
rolling the planar die, but be prepared for the occasional chaotic
result!</p>

<div class="section" id="archenemy">
<h4>Archenemy<a class="headerlink" href="#archenemy" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>In an Archenemy game, one player starts with 40 life and an
extra deck of oversized scheme cards. That player is known as the
archenemy. The other players play as a team and try to defeat the
archenemy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tips">
<h4>Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#tips" title="Stały odnośnik do tego nagłówka">¶</a></h4>
<p>In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a mulligan, he or she draws a new hand
of seven cards rather than six cards. Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal.
In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first
turn. In all other multiplayer games, no player skips the draw step of his or her first turn.</p>

<dt id="term-tap-tap"><img alt="{T}" src="_images/tap.png" /> (tap)</dt>
<dd>This symbol means „tap this card” (turn it sideways to show that it’s been
used). It appears in activation costs. You can’t pay a oT cost if the card is
already tapped. Also, remember that you can’t pay your creature’s oT costs
until the creature starts your turn on the battlefield under your control.</dd>

<dd>Hybrid mana symbols represent a cost that can be paid with either
of two colors. For example, a cost represented by the oh1 symbol
can be paid with one white mana or one blue mana. It’s both a
white and a blue mana symbol, and a card with oh1 in its mana
cost is both white and blue.</dd>
<dt id="term-ability">Ability</dt>
<dd>Any text on a permanent (except reminder text and flavor text) tells
you the permanent’s abilities. There are three kinds of abilities a
permanent can have: activated abilities, static abilities, and triggered
abilities. Unless they say otherwise, abilities „work” only while the
permanent they’re on is on the battlefield. Once a triggered ability
triggers or an activated ability is activated, it will resolve unless
it’s countered; it doesn’t matter what happens to the source of the
ability once the ability goes on the stack. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-activated-abilities"><span class="std std-ref">Activated Abilities</span></a>
[on page 12].</dd>
<dt id="term-activate">Activate</dt>
<dd>You activate an activated ability by putting it on the stack. You
activate an ability just as you cast a spell: announce it, choose its
targets, and pay its activation cost. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-activated-abilities"><span class="std std-ref">Activated Abilities</span></a>
[on page 12].</dd>
<dt id="term">*/*</dt>
<dd>Instead of numbers, some creatures have stars for their power and
toughness. This means the creature’s power and toughness are set
by an ability it has rather than being fixed numbers. For example,
Nightmare has an ability that reads „Nightmare’s power and
toughness are each equal to the number of Swamps you control.” If
you control four Swamps when Nightmare enters the battlefield, it
will be 4/4. If you play more Swamps later on, it will get even bigger.</dd>
<dt id="term-activated-ability">Activated ability</dt>
<dd>One of the three kinds of abilities a permanent can have. An
activated ability is always written in the form „cost: effect.” See
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-abilities"><span class="std std-ref">Abilities</span></a> [on page 12].</dd>
<dt id="term-active-player">Active player</dt>
<dd>The player whose turn it is. The active player always gets the first
chance to cast spells and activate abilities.</dd>
<dt id="term-additional-cost">Additional cost</dt>
<dd>Some spells say they have an additional cost. To cast that spell, you
must pay both the mana cost in the upper right corner of the card
and its additional cost.</dd>
<dt id="term-archenemy">Archenemy</dt>
<dd>A one-on-many multiplayer variant that features oversized scheme
cards.</dd>
<dt id="term-artifact">Artifact</dt>
<dd>A card type. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-artifact"><span class="std std-ref">Artifact</span></a> [on page 6].</dd>
<dt id="term-artifact-creature">Artifact creature</dt>
<dd>This is both an artifact and a creature. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-creature"><span class="std std-ref">Creature</span></a> [on page 6].</dd>
<dt id="term-attack">Attack</dt>
<dd>How your creatures deal damage to your opponent. During
your combat phase, you decide which, if any, of your untapped
creatures will attack, and which player or planeswalker they will
attack, then they all do so at once. Attacking causes creatures
to tap. Creatures can attack only players or planeswalkers, not
other creatures. Your opponent then gets a chance to block your
attacking creatures with his or her own creatures. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-attacking-and-blocking"><span class="std std-ref">Attacking and Blocking</span></a> [on page 13].</dd>
<dt id="term-attacking-creature">Attacking creature</dt>
<dd>A creature that’s attacking. A creature is attacking from the time
it’s declared as an attacker until the combat phase ends, unless
it’s somehow removed from combat. There’s no such thing as an
attacking creature outside of the combat phase.</dd>
<dt id="term-aura">Aura</dt>
<dd>A special type of enchantment that can be attached to a permanent
(or sometimes a player). Each Aura has the keyword „enchant”
followed by what it can be attached to: „enchant creature,” „enchant
land,” and so on. When you cast an Aura spell, you choose one
of the right kind of permanent to target. When the Aura resolves,
it’s put onto the battlefield attached to that permanent (it’s not
targeting it anymore). If an Aura is ever attached to something that
doesn’t match its enchant ability—or attached to nothing at all—it’s
put into its owner’s graveyard.</dd>
<dt id="term-basic-land">Basic land</dt>
<dd><p class="first"><a class="reference internal" href="_images/forest_1.png"><img alt="Forest" src="_images/forest_1.png" style="width: 187.5px; height: 261.5px;" /></a></p>
<p>There are five basic lands. Plains make <img alt="{W}" src="_images/mana_w.png" /> (white mana). Islands make <img alt="{U}" src="_images/mana_u.png" /> (blue
mana). Swamps make <img alt="{B}" src="_images/mana_b.png" /> (black mana). Mountains make <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> (red mana). Forests
make <img alt="{G}" src="_images/mana_g.png" /> (green mana). They each say „basic” on their type line (basic is a
supertype). Lands other than these five are called nonbasic lands.</p>
<p class="last">When building a deck, you can include any number of basic lands. You
can’t have more than four copies of any other cards in your deck.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-basic-land-type">Basic land type</dt>
<dd>Each basic land has a subtype, which appears after „Basic Land —”
on its type line. These are the „basic land types,” which are the same
five words as the basic land names. Some nonbasic lands also have
basic land types. Any land with a basic land type has an activated
ability that makes one mana of the appropriate color, even if it doesn’t
say so in the text box. For example, every Forest has the ability „<img alt="{T}" src="_images/tap.png" />:
Add <img alt="{G}" src="_images/mana_g.png" /> to your mana pool.”</dd>
<dt id="term-battlefield">Battlefield</dt>
<dd>A game zone. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-battlefield"><span class="std std-ref">Battlefield</span></a> [on page 8].</dd>
<dt id="term-block">Block</dt>
<dd>To stop an attacking creature from damaging you or one of your
planeswalkers by having it fight one of your creatures instead.
After your opponent attacks with one or more creatures, you can
have any number of your untapped creatures block. Each one can
block one attacking creature. You can have two or more of your
untapped creatures gang up and block a single attacking creature. If
an attacker is blocked, it will deal its combat damage to the creature
blocking it instead of to the player or planeswalker it was attacking.
Blocking is optional. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-attacking-and-blocking"><span class="std std-ref">Attacking and Blocking</span></a>
[on page 13].</dd>
<dt id="term-blocked-creature">Blocked creature</dt>
<dd>An attacking creature that’s blocked by at least one creature. Once
a creature is blocked, it stays blocked for the rest of the combat
phase—even if all the creatures blocking it leave combat. In other
words, once a creature is blocked, there’s no way for it to deal
damage to the player or planeswalker it’s attacking (unless the
attacking creature has trample). There’s no such thing as a blocked
creature outside of the combat phase.</dd>
<dt id="term-blocking-creature">Blocking creature</dt>
<dd>A creature assigned to block an attacking creature. If a creature
blocks an attacker, the attacker deals its damage to the blocker
instead of to the player or planeswalker it’s attacking. Once a
creature blocks, it stays a blocking creature for the rest of the
combat phase—even if the creature it’s blocking leaves combat.
There’s no such thing as a blocking creature outside of the
combat phase.</dd>
<dt id="term-booster-booster-pack">Booster, booster pack</dt>
<dd>A pack of randomly assorted Magic cards. When you want to
add more cards to your collection, this is what you’ll get. Most
15-card booster packs contain one rare or mythic rare card,
three uncommon cards, and eleven common cards, including
one basic land card. Find stores where Magic cards are sold at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizards.com/Locator/">Wizards.com/Locator</a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-booster-draft">Booster Draft</dt>
<dd>See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-limited-formats"><span class="std std-ref">Limited Formats</span></a> [on page 19].</dd>
<dt id="term-card-type">Card type</dt>
<dd>Every card in your deck has at least one card type: artifact, creature,
enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, or sorcery. A card’s type is
printed under its illustration. Some cards, like artifact creatures, have
more than one type. Some cards also have subtypes, such as „Goblin”
and „Warrior” in „Creature — Goblin Warrior,” or supertypes, such
as „basic” in „Basic Land — Forest.”</dd>
<dt id="term-cast">Cast</dt>
<dd>You cast a spell by putting it on the stack. Different kinds of spells
can be cast at different times, but the things you have to do to
cast a spell are always the same: announce it, choose its targets
(and make certain other choices right away), and pay its cost. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-spells"><span class="std std-ref">Spells</span></a> [on page 10].</dd>
<dt id="term-choose-one">Choose one —</dt>
<dd>When you see the phrase „Choose one —” on a card, you have to
choose one option on the card when you cast it. You can’t change
your mind and choose something else later on, even if your first
choice doesn’t work out.</dd>
<dt id="term-color">Color</dt>
<dd><p class="first"><a class="reference internal" href="_images/star_seating.jpg"><img alt="colorwheel" src="_images/star_seating.jpg" style="width: 250.0px; height: 225.0px;" /></a></p>
<p>The five Magic colors are white, blue, black, red, and green. If a spell
or ability tells you to choose a color, you must choose one of those five.
A card’s color is determined by its mana cost. For example, a card that
costs 1U is blue and a card that costs RW is both red and
white. Cards with no colored mana in their mana costs, like most artifacts,
are colorless. (Colorless is not a color.) Lands are also colorless.</p>
<p class="last">Some effects can change a spell or permanent’s color. For
example, „Target creature becomes blue until end of turn.” The new
color replaces the previous colors, unless the ability says otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-colorless">Colorless</dt>
<dd>Lands and most artifacts are colorless. Colorless is not a color. If
something tells you to choose a color, you can’t choose colorless.</dd>
<dt id="term-combat">Combat</dt>
<dd>In general, combat means attacking, blocking, and all the stuff
that happens during a combat phase.</dd>
<dt id="term-combat-damage">Combat damage</dt>
<dd>Damage dealt by creatures due to attacking and blocking. A
creature deals combat damage equal to its power. This damage is
dealt during the combat damage step. Any other kind of damage
doesn’t count as combat damage, even if it’s dealt as the result of a
creature’s ability during combat.</dd>
<dt id="term-combat-damage-step">Combat damage step</dt>

<dt id="term-command-zone">Command zone</dt>
<dd>A game zone used for objects that affect the game but aren’t
permanents. Some planeswalkers create emblems that go here, and
some multiplayer variants use this zone for their oversized cards.</dd>
<dt id="term-commander">Commander</dt>
<dd>A casual variant in which each player’s deck is led by a legendary
creature.</dd>
<dt id="term-concede">Concede</dt>
<dd>To stop playing a game and give your opponent the victory. You
can concede a game at any time (usually if you realize you won’t
be able to avoid losing). When you concede, you lose the game.</dd>
<dt id="term-constructed">Constructed</dt>
<dd>A group of play formats that use decks you build in advance. A
Constructed deck must have at least 60 cards, and it can’t have
more than four copies of any single card (except for basic lands).
Standard is the most popular Constructed format.</dd>
<dt id="term-continuous-effect">Continuous effect</dt>
<dd>An effect that lasts for some duration. These are different from
one-shot effects, which just happen once and don’t have a
duration. You can tell how long a continuous effect will last by
reading the spell or ability it came from. For example, it might say
„until end of turn.” If the continuous effect comes from a static
ability, it lasts as long as the permanent with the ability is on the
battlefield.</dd>
<dt id="term-control">Control</dt>
<dd><p class="first">You control spells you cast and permanents that entered the
battlefield on your side. You also control abilities that come from
permanents you control.</p>
<p>Only you can make decisions for things you control. If you
control a permanent, only you can activate its activated abilities.
Even if you put an Aura on your opponent’s creature, you control
the Aura and its abilities.</p>
<p class="last">Some spells and abilities let you gain control of a permanent.
Most of the time, this means the card will move from your
opponent’s side to yours. But for Auras or Equipment attached to
other cards, the controller changes but it doesn’t move.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-controller">Controller</dt>
<dd>A spell’s controller is the player who cast it. An activated ability’s
controller is the player who activated it. A permanent’s controller
is the player who cast it—unless another spell or ability changes
who controls it. A triggered ability’s controller is the player who
controlled the source of the ability when it triggered.</dd>
<dt id="term-converted-mana-cost">Converted mana cost</dt>
<dd>The total amount of mana in a mana cost, regardless of color. For
example, a card with a mana cost of 3UU has a converted mana
cost of 5. A card with mana cost RR has a converted mana cost
of 2.</dd>
<dt id="term-cost">Cost</dt>
<dd>A cost is something you have to pay to take another action. You must
pay a cost to cast a spell or activate an activated ability. Sometimes
a spell or ability will also ask you to pay a cost when it resolves.
You can’t pay a cost unless you can pay all of it. For example, if an
activated ability’s cost (the part before the „:”) tells you to discard a
card and you have no cards in your hand, you can’t even try to pay it.</dd>
<dt id="term-counter-a-spell-or-ability">Counter a spell or ability</dt>
<dd>To cancel out a spell or ability so it has no effect. If a spell is
countered, it’s removed from the stack and put into its owner’s
graveyard. Once a spell or ability starts to resolve, it’s too late to
counter it. Lands aren’t spells, so they can’t be countered.</dd>
<dt id="term-counter-on-a-permanent">Counter on a permanent</dt>
<dd>Some spells and abilities tell you to put a counter on a permanent.
The counter marks a change to the permanent that lasts for as long
as it’s on the battlefield. A counter usually changes a creature’s power
and toughness or tracks a planeswalker’s current loyalty. You can use
anything you want as counters: glass beads, dice, or whatever.</dd>
<dt id="term-creature">Creature</dt>
<dd>A card type. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-creature"><span class="std std-ref">Creature</span></a> [on page 6].</dd>
<dt id="term-creature-type">Creature type</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This tells you what kind of creature a creature is, such as Goblin,
Elf, or Warrior. You find creature types in the middle of the card
after „Creature — .” If a creature has more than one word after the
dash, the creature has all of those creature types.</p>
<p class="last">Some spells and abilities affect multiple creatures with a certain
type. For example, Predatory Sliver reads „Sliver creatures you
control get +1/+1.” All creatures you control with the Sliver
creature type, including Predatory Sliver, get the bonus.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-damage">Damage</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This is what knocks down a player’s life total, lowers a planeswalker’s
loyalty, and destroys creatures. Attacking and blocking creatures
deal damage equal to their power. Some spells and abilities can also
deal damage. Damage can be dealt only to creatures, planeswalkers,
or players. If a creature is dealt damage equal to or greater than
its toughness in one turn, it’s destroyed. If a planeswalker is dealt
damage, that many loyalty counters are removed from it. If a player
is dealt damage, it’s subtracted from the player’s life total.</p>
<p class="last">Damage is different from losing life. For example, Dark Favor is
an Aura with the drawback „When Dark Favor enters the battlefield,
you lose 1 life.” That loss of life isn’t damage, so it can’t be prevented.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-deathtouch">Deathtouch</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures. Deathtouch is an ability that
causes a creature to deal an exceptionally lethal form of damage
to other creatures. A creature dealt any amount of damage by
a creature with deathtouch is destroyed. If your creature with
deathtouch is blocked by multiple creatures, you can assign as
little as 1 damage to each of the blocking creatures!</dd>
<dt id="term-deck">Deck</dt>
<dd>At least 60 cards of your choice, well shuffled. (Limited formats in
which players build their decks as part of the event allow 40-card
decks.) To play a Magic game, you must have your own deck.

<dt id="term-defender">Defender</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures. Creatures with defender can’t
attack.</dd>
<dt id="term-defending-player">Defending player</dt>
<dd>The player who is being attacked (or whose planeswalker is being
attacked) during a combat phase.</dd>
<dt id="term-destroy">Destroy</dt>
<dd><p class="first">To move a permanent from the battlefield to its owner’s graveyard.
Creatures are destroyed when they’ve taken damage equal to or
greater than their toughness. Also, lots of spells and abilities can
destroy permanents (without dealing damage to them).</p>
<p class="last">Sometimes permanents are put into the graveyard without
being destroyed. If a permanent is sacrificed, it isn’t „destroyed,”
but it’s still put into its owner’s graveyard. The same is true if
a creature’s toughness is reduced to 0 or less, two legendary
permanents with the same name controlled by the same player
are on the battlefield, two planeswalkers with the same subtype
controlled by the same player are on the battlefield, or an Aura
is on the battlefield but isn’t enchanting what’s described in its
„enchant” ability.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-dies">Dies</dt>
<dd>„Dies” is another way to say that a creature „is put into a graveyard
from the battlefield.”</dd>
<dt id="term-discard">Discard</dt>
<dd><p class="first">To take a card from your hand and put it into your graveyard. If a
spell or ability makes you discard cards, you get to choose which
cards to discard—unless the spell or ability says another player
chooses the cards or you have to discard „at random.”</p>
<p class="last">If you have more than seven cards in your hand during your own
cleanup step, you have to discard until you have seven.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-double-strike">Double strike</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures. Creatures with double strike
deal their combat damage twice. When you reach the combat
damage step, check to see if any attacking or blocking creatures
have first strike or double strike. If so, an extra combat damage
step is created just for them. Only creatures with first strike and
double strike get to deal combat damage in this step. After that,
the normal combat damage step happens. All remaining attacking
and blocking creatures, as well as the ones with double strike, deal
combat damage during this second step.</dd>
<dt id="term-draw-a-card">Draw a card</dt>
<dd>To take the top card of your library (deck) and put it into your
hand. You draw one card during each of your turns, at the start
of your draw step. You also draw if a spell or ability lets you; this
doesn’t affect your normal draw for the turn. If a spell or ability
lets you put a card into your hand from your library but doesn’t
use the word „draw,” it doesn’t count as drawing a card.</dd>
<dt id="term-draw-step">Draw step</dt>
<dd>See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-parts-of-the-turn"><span class="std std-ref">Parts of the Turn</span></a> [on page 17].</dd>
<dt id="term-draw-the-game">Draw the game</dt>
<dd>The other meaning of „draw” is a game that ends with no winner.
For example, if a spell like Earthquake deals enough damage so
that both players drop to 0 or less life, the game is a draw.</dd>
<dt id="term-effect">Effect</dt>
<dd>What a spell or ability does when it resolves. There are several
types of effects: <a class="reference internal" href="#term-one-shot-effect"><span class="xref std std-term">one-shot effects</span></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-continuous-effect"><span class="xref std std-term">continuous effects</span></a>,

You can look up each one in this glossary.</dd>
<dt id="term-emblem">Emblem</dt>
<dd>Some planeswalkers» abilities create an emblem that leaves a
lasting effect on the game. Once an emblem is created, it can’t be
destroyed and its abilities apply until the game ends.</dd>
<dt id="term-enchant">Enchant</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on all Auras. It’s usually followed by a
description of a permanent (for example, „enchant creature” or
„enchant land”), which tells you what kind of permanent the
Aura can be attached to. When you cast the Aura, you must target
that kind of permanent. Similarly, Auras with „enchant player” or
„enchant opponent” target a player when they’re cast. If an Aura is
ever attached to something that doesn’t match its enchant ability,
it’s put into its owner’s graveyard.</dd>
<dt id="term-enchanted">Enchanted</dt>
<dd>When an ability of an Aura says „enchanted creature” (or „enchanted
artifact,” „enchanted land,” and so on), it means „the creature the Aura
is attached to.” For example, Mark of the Vampire has the ability „Enchanted
creature gets +2/+2 and has lifelink.” Only the creature that Mark of the
Vampire is attached to gets the bonus, and that creature’s controller will gain
life from its lifelink ability.</dd>
<dt id="term-enchantment">Enchantment</dt>
<dd>A card type. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-enchantment"><span class="std std-ref">Enchantment</span></a> [on page 6].</dd>

<dt id="term-enters-the-battlefield">Enters the battlefield</dt>
<dd><p class="first">When artifact, creature, enchantment, and planeswalker spells
resolve, they enter the battlefield as permanents. Lands also enter
the battlefield as permanents.</p>
<p>Some triggered abilities start with „When [this permanent] enters
the battlefield, … .” When a permanent with an ability like this is
put onto the battlefield, this ability triggers right away. Some abilities
also trigger when certain other permanents enter the battlefield.</p>
<p class="last">Some cards say they enter the battlefield tapped. These cards
don’t enter the battlefield and become tapped—they’re already
tapped by the time they’re put onto the battlefield. Similarly,
creatures that „enter the battlefield with (some number of) +1/+1
counters,” or whose power or toughness will be modified by a
continuous effect, don’t enter the battlefield and then change size.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-equip">Equip</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on all Equipment. It tells you how much it
costs to attach the Equipment to one of your creatures. It doesn’t
matter whether the Equipment is unattached or is attached to a
different creature. You can activate this ability only during your
main phase, when no spells or abilities are on the stack. The equip
ability targets the creature you’re moving the Equipment onto.</dd>
<dt id="term-equipment">Equipment</dt>
<dd>A type of artifact that represents a weapon, armor, or other item
that your creatures can use. When you cast an Equipment spell,
it enters the battlefield like any other artifact. Once it’s on the
battlefield, you can pay its equip cost any time you could cast a
sorcery to attach it to a creature you control. You can do this even
if the Equipment is attached to another creature. Once it’s attached
to a creature, the Equipment then has some effect on it. If the
equipped creature leaves the battlefield, the Equipment „drops to
the ground” and stays on the battlefield, waiting for you to attach
it to another creature.</dd>
<dt id="term-evasion-ability">Evasion ability</dt>
<dd>A nickname for any ability that makes a creature harder to block.
Flying is the most common evasion ability.</dd>
<dt id="term-exile">Exile</dt>
<dd>A game zone. Exile is essentially a holding area for cards. If a spell
or ability exiles a card, that card is moved to the exile zone from
wherever it is. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-exile"><span class="std std-ref">Exile</span></a> [on page 8].</dd>

<dt id="term-fight">Fight</dt>
<dd>Some effects cause a creature to fight another creature. When two
creatures fight, each deals damage equal to its power to the other.</dd>
<dt id="term-first-strike">First strike</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures. Creatures with first strike deal
their combat damage before creatures without first strike. When
you reach the combat damage step, check to see if any attacking
or blocking creatures have first strike or double strike. If so, an
extra combat damage step is created just for them. Only creatures
with first strike and double strike get to deal combat damage in
this step. After that, the normal combat damage step happens. All
remaining attacking and blocking creatures, as well as the ones
with double strike, deal combat damage during this second step.</dd>
<dt id="term-flash">Flash</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures, artifacts, and enchantments.
A spell with flash can be cast any time you could cast an instant.</dd>
<dt id="term-flavor-text">Flavor text</dt>
<dd>Italic text (italic text looks like this) in a card’s text box that’s just for
fun. Flavor text sets a tone or describes part of the magical world of
the card. If the text is in parentheses, it’s there to remind you about
a rule—it’s not flavor text. Flavor text has no effect on how the card
is cast.</dd>
<dt id="term-flying">Flying</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures. A creature with flying can’t be
blocked except by creatures with flying or reach.</dd>
<dt id="term-forestwalk">Forestwalk</dt>

<dt id="term-haste">Haste</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures. A creature with haste can
attack as soon as it comes under your control. You can also
activate its activated abilities with oT in the cost.</dd>
<dt id="term-hexproof">Hexproof</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on permanents. A permanent with
hexproof can’t be the target of spells or abilities controlled by an
opponent. The player who controls the permanent with hexproof
can still target it with spells and abilities.</dd>
<dt id="term-indestructible">Indestructible</dt>
<dd>An indestructible permanent can’t be destroyed by damage or by
effects that say „destroy.” It can still be put into the graveyard for
other reasons. See the glossary entry for <a class="reference internal" href="#term-destroy"><span class="xref std std-term">Destroy</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-instant">Instant</dt>
<dd>A card type. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-instant"><span class="std std-ref">Instant</span></a> [on page 6].</dd>
<dt id="term-instead">Instead</dt>
<dd>When you see this word, you know a spell or ability creates a replacement
effect. See the glossary entry for <a class="reference internal" href="#term-replacement-effect"><span class="xref std std-term">Replacement effect</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-intimidate">Intimidate</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures. A creature with intimidate
can’t be blocked except by creatures that share a color with it and/
or artifact creatures. For example, a red creature with intimidate
could be blocked by a red creature, a red-and-green creature, or any
artifact creature. Intimidate only matters when the creature with the
ability is attacking.</dd>
<dt id="term-intro-pack">Intro pack</dt>
<dd>A pack that includes a ready-to-play deck featuring cards from a
particular set, as well as two bonus 15-card booster packs. You can play
decks from intro packs against each other right out of the box. The
Magic 2014 core set has five intro packs. When you’re just starting to
play, modifying the deck from a Magic intro pack is a good way to start
designing your own decks. Find stores where Magic cards are sold at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizards.com/Locator/">Wizards.com/Locator</a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-islandwalk">Islandwalk</dt>

<dt id="term-landwalk">Landwalk</dt>
<dd>Landwalk is the name for a group of keyword abilities that
includes plainswalk, islandwalk, swampwalk, mountainwalk,
and forestwalk. A creature with landwalk is unblockable if the
defending player controls at least one land of the specified type.</dd>
<dt id="term-leaves-the-battlefield">Leaves the battlefield</dt>
<dd>A permanent leaves the battlefield when it moves from the
battlefield zone to any other zone. It might return to a player’s
hand from the battlefield, go to a graveyard from the battlefield,
or go to some other zone. If a card leaves the battlefield and later
returns to the battlefield, it’s like a brand-new card. It doesn’t
„remember” anything from the last time it was on the battlefield.</dd>
<dt id="term-legendary">Legendary</dt>
<dd>Legendary is a supertype, so you’ll find it written on the type line
before the card type. If a player controls two or more legendary
permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them
to stay on the battlefield and the rest are put into their owner’s
graveyard. (Different players can control legendary permanents
with the same name.) This is known as the „legend rule.”</dd>
<dt id="term-library">Library</dt>
<dd>A game zone. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-library"><span class="std std-ref">Library</span></a> [on page 8].</dd>
<dt id="term-life-life-total">Life, life total</dt>
<dd>Each player begins the game with 20 life. When you’re dealt
damage by spells, abilities, or unblocked creatures, you subtract
the damage from your life total. If your life total drops to 0 or less,
you lose the game. If something causes both players» life totals to
drop to 0 or less at the same time, the game is a draw.</dd>
<dt id="term-lifelink">Lifelink</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on permanents. Damage dealt by a
permanent with lifelink causes that permanent’s controller to
gain that much life, in addition to behaving like normal damage.</dd>
<dt id="term-limited">Limited</dt>
<dd>A group of play formats using cards from booster packs you open
just before you play. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-limited-formats"><span class="std std-ref">Limited Formats</span></a> [on page 19].</dd>
<dt id="term-losing-life">Losing life</dt>
<dd>All damage dealt to you causes you to lose life, which is why
it’s subtracted from your life total. In addition, some spells and
abilities say that they cause you to lose life. This isn’t the same as
damage, so it can’t be prevented.</dd>
<dt id="term-loyalty">Loyalty</dt>
<dd>Loyalty is a characteristic that only planeswalkers have. Each planeswalker
card has a loyalty number printed in its lower right corner: that’s how many
loyalty counters it gets as it enters the battlefield. The cost to activate one of
a planeswalker’s activated abilities is to put loyalty counters on it or remove
loyalty counters from it. Each 1 damage dealt to a planeswalker causes a loyalty
counter to be removed from it. If a planeswalker has no loyalty counters on it,
it’s put into its owner’s graveyard. See also <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-planeswalker"><span class="std std-ref">Planeswalker</span></a>

<dt id="term-mana">Mana</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The magical energy you use to pay for spells and some abilities.</p>
<p class="last">Most mana comes from tapping lands. There are five colors of

There’s also colorless mana.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-mana-ability">Mana ability</dt>
<dd>An ability that adds mana to your mana pool. Mana abilities can
be activated abilities or triggered abilities. A mana ability doesn’t
go on the stack when you activate it or it triggers—you simply get
the mana immediately.</dd>
<dt id="term-mana-cost">Mana cost</dt>

<dd>The place where your mana is stored until you spend it or until
the current step or phase ends.</dd>
<dt id="term-match">Match</dt>
<dd>A series of games against the same opponent. Most matches are
best two out of three, so the first player to win two games wins
the match. The loser of the first game decides who goes first in
the second game, and so on.</dd>
<dt id="term-modern">Modern</dt>
<dd>A Constructed format that’s growing in popularity. The Modern
format uses core sets and blocks from Eighth Edition and
Mirrodin® to the present. See <a class="reference external" href="http://wizards.com/MagicFormats/">Wizards.com/MagicFormats</a>

<dt id="term-mulligan">Mulligan</dt>
<dd>At the beginning of a Magic game, you draw the top seven
cards of your library. If you don’t like that hand of cards for
any reason, you can mulligan. When you mulligan, your hand
is shuffled into your library and you draw a new hand of one
fewer cards. You can mulligan as many times as you want, but
you draw one fewer card each time. When both players like their
opening hands, you start playing.</dd>
<dt id="term-multicolored-card">Multicolored card</dt>
<dd>A card with more than one color of mana in its mana cost. For
example, a card with the mana cost <img alt="{2}" src="_images/mana_2.png" /> <img alt="{B}" src="_images/mana_b.png" /> <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> is both black and red.
Most multicolored cards have a gold background.</dd>

<p class="last">When a card’s name appears in its text box, the card is referring
to itself, not to any other cards with the same name.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-non">Non-</dt>
<dd>When a spell or ability’s text refers to a „nonland card” or a
„nonblack creature,” and so on, it means „a card that’s not a land,”
„a creature that’s not black,” and so on.</dd>
<dt id="term-nonbasic-land">Nonbasic land</dt>
<dd>Any land that doesn’t have the supertype „basic” on its type line—
in other words, any land not named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, or
Forest. You can’t put more than four copies of any one nonbasic land card
into a deck.</dd>
<dt id="term-one-shot-effect">One-shot effect</dt>
<dd>An effect that applies to the game once, and then it’s done. For example,
Divination reads, „Draw two cards.” When it resolves, its effect is done.
One-shot effects differ from continuous effects, which last for some amount of time.</dd>
<dt id="term-opponent">Opponent</dt>
<dd>A person you’re playing against. If a card says „an opponent,” it
means one of its controller’s opponents.</dd>
<dt id="term-owner">Owner</dt>
<dd>The person who started the game with the card in his or her deck.
Even if your opponent has control of one of your permanents,
you’re still its owner. (If you loaned your friend a deck, he or she
will be the „owner” of all the cards in it during the game.) The
owner of a token is the player who controlled it when it entered
the battlefield.</dd>
<dt id="term-paying-life">Paying life</dt>
<dd>Sometimes a spell or ability will ask you to pay life as part of its
cost. To pay life, subtract that amount of life from your life total.
You can’t pay more life than you have. Paying life isn’t damage, so
it can’t be prevented.</dd>
<dt id="term-permanent">Permanent</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A card or creature token on the battlefield. Permanents can be
artifacts, creatures, enchantments, lands, or planeswalkers. Once
a permanent is on the battlefield, it stays there until it’s destroyed,
sacrificed, or removed somehow. You can’t remove a permanent from
the battlefield just because you want to, even if you control it. If a
permanent leaves the battlefield and then re-enters the battlefield, it’s
treated like a brand-new card. It doesn’t „remember” anything about
the last time it was on the battlefield.</p>
<p class="last">Unless they say otherwise, spells and abilities affect only
permanents. For example, Unsummon reads, „Return target
creature to its owner’s hand.” You must target a creature on the
battlefield, not a creature card in a graveyard or anywhere else.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-permanent-type">Permanent type</dt>
<dd>The permanent types are artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and
planeswalker. Permanents can have more than one type.</dd>
<dt id="term-phase">Phase</dt>
<dd>One of the main sections of a turn. There are five: beginning phase,
first main phase, combat phase, second main phase, and ending
phase. Some phases are divided into steps. If a player has mana left
over as a step or phase ends, that mana is lost.

<dt id="term-planeswalker-type">Planeswalker type</dt>
<dd>A subtype of a planeswalker. If a player controls two or more
planeswalkers with the same planeswalker type, that player chooses

owner’s graveyard. (Different players can control planeswalkers with
the same planeswalker type.)</dd>
<dt id="term-play">Play</dt>
<dd><p class="first">You play a land by putting it onto the battlefield from your hand.
You can play a land only once each turn during one of your main
phases when nothing’s on the stack. Lands don’t go on the stack
when you play them.</p>
<p class="last">Some effects tell you to play a card. That means to play a land
or cast a spell, depending on the card’s type.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-player">Player</dt>
<dd>Either you or your opponent. If a spell or ability lets you choose
a player, you can choose yourself. You can’t choose yourself if it
says „opponent.” If you’re playing a multiplayer game (a game
with more than two players), everyone in the game is a player,
including your teammates.</dd>
<dt id="term-power">Power</dt>
<dd>The number to the left of the slash in the box in the lower right
corner of a creature card. A creature deals combat damage equal

combat.</dd>
<dt id="term-prevent">Prevent</dt>
<dd>When you see this word in the text of a spell or ability, you know
it’s a prevention effect.</dd>
<dt id="term-prevention-effect">Prevention effect</dt>
<dd><p class="first">An effect that stops damage from being dealt. A prevention effect
works like a shield. If damage would be dealt but a prevention
shield is in place, some or all of that damage isn’t dealt. A
prevention effect can prevent all damage a source would deal, or it
can prevent just a specific amount of damage.</p>
<p>For example, Fog reads, „Prevent all combat damage that would
be dealt this turn.” You can cast Fog long before combat, and its
effect will hang around for the whole turn. Then, if creatures try
to deal combat damage during that turn, Fog prevents it.</p>
<p class="last">Prevention effects can prevent damage from being dealt to
creatures, to players, or both. If a prevention effect could prevent
damage from being dealt by multiple sources at the same time,
the player who would be dealt that damage, or who controls the
creature that would be dealt that damage, chooses which source to
prevent the damage from.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-priority">Priority</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Since players can cast instants and activate abilities during each
other’s turns, the game needs a system that makes sure only one
player can do something at a time. Priority determines, at any given
time, which player can cast a spell or activate an activated ability.</p>
<p>The active player (the player whose turn it is) gets priority at the
beginning of each step and each main phase—except for the untap
step and the cleanup step. When you get priority, you can cast a spell,
activate an activated ability, or pass (choose to do nothing). If you do
something, you keep priority, so you make the same choice again.
If you pass, your opponent gets priority, so now he or she gets that
choice. This goes back and forth until both players pass in a row.</p>
<p class="last">When both players pass in a row, if there’s a spell or ability
waiting on the stack, it resolves. Then the active player gets
priority again, and the system repeats. When both players pass in
a row, if there’s no spell or ability waiting on the stack, that part of
the turn ends and the next one begins.</p>

<li>The creature can’t be blocked by those kinds of creatures.</li>
<li>The creature can’t be targeted by those kinds of spells or by
abilities from those kinds of cards.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt id="term-put-onto-the-battlefield">Put onto the battlefield</dt>
<dd>To move a card or token into the battlefield zone. When a spell or
ability tells you to put something onto the battlefield, that’s not the
same as casting it. You just put it onto the battlefield without paying
its costs.</dd>
<dt id="term-rarity">Rarity</dt>
<dd>How likely it is you’ll get a particular card. There are four
levels of rarity for Magic cards: common, uncommon,
rare, and mythic rare. Each 15-card booster pack typically
has eleven common cards including one basic land card, three uncommon cards, and one rare
card. Some boosters have a mythic rare card instead of a rare card.</dd>
<dt id="term-reach">Reach</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures. A creature with reach can
block a creature with flying. However, a creature with reach can
be blocked by any kind of creature.</dd>
<dt id="term-regenerate">Regenerate</dt>
<dd><p class="first">To prevent a permanent from being destroyed later in the turn. A regeneration effect
works like a shield. A spell or ability that says „Regenerate [a permanent]” puts
a regeneration shield on that permanent that can be used up at any time during the turn.
If a permanent would be destroyed and it has a regeneration shield, it’s not
destroyed. Instead, it becomes tapped, it’s removed from combat (if it’s an attacking
or blocking creature), and all damage is removed from it. That regeneration shield is
then used up. The permanent never leaves the battlefield, so any
Auras, Equipment, or counters that were on it remain there. Any
unused regeneration shields go away during the cleanup step.</p>
<p class="last">Although a permanent with a regeneration shield can’t be
destroyed, it can still be put into the graveyard for other reasons.
See the glossary entry for <a class="reference internal" href="#term-destroy"><span class="xref std std-term">Destroy</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-reminder-text">Reminder text</dt>
<dd>Italic text in parentheses (like this) in the text box that reminds you
of a rule or keyword ability. Reminder text isn’t meant to tell you all
the rules for an ability. It just reminds you of how the card works.</dd>
<dt id="term-remove-from-combat">Remove from combat</dt>
<dd>If an effect removes a creature from combat, it’s not attacking or
blocking anymore. If it blocked a creature before it was removed,
the attacking creature stays blocked, so no damage would get
through to the player or planeswalker that’s being attacked. A
creature that’s removed from combat neither deals nor is dealt
combat damage.</dd>
<dt id="term-replacement-effect">Replacement effect</dt>
<dd>A kind of effect that waits for a particular event and then replaces
that event with a different one. Replacement effects have the
word „instead” in them. For example, Darksteel Colossus reads,
in part, „If Darksteel Colossus would be put into a graveyard from
anywhere, reveal Darksteel Colossus and shuffle it into its owner’s
library instead.” The effect replaces the action of putting Darksteel
Colossus into the graveyard with the action of shuffling it into its
owner’s library. Darksteel Colossus never hits the graveyard at all.</dd>
<dt id="term-resolve">Resolve</dt>
<dd>When you cast a spell or activate an activated ability, or when
a triggered ability triggers, nothing happens right away. It just
goes on the stack. After each player gets a chance to respond to
it, it will resolve and its effect will happen. If another spell or
ability counters it, or if none of its targets are legal when it tries
to resolve, it won’t resolve at all (and if it’s a spell, it’s put into its
owner’s graveyard).</dd>
<dt id="term-respond-in-response">Respond, in response</dt>
<dd>To cast an instant or activate an activated ability right after another
spell or ability has been put on the stack.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-responding-to-a-spell"><span class="std std-ref">Responding to a Spell</span></a> [on page 10].</dd>
<dt id="term-reveal">Reveal</dt>
<dd>When you reveal a card, it’s shown to all the players in the game.</dd>
<dt id="term-sacrifice">Sacrifice</dt>
<dd>To choose one of your permanents on the battlefield and put it
into its owner’s graveyard. You can sacrifice only permanents you
control. Sacrificing a permanent is different from destroying it, so
the permanent can’t be regenerated. You can sacrifice a permanent
only if a spell or ability tells you to, or if it’s part of a cost.</dd>
<dt id="term-sealed-deck">Sealed Deck</dt>
<dd>See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-limited-formats"><span class="std std-ref">Limited Formats</span></a> [on page 19].</dd>
<dt id="term-shuffle">Shuffle</dt>
<dd>To randomize the order of the cards in your deck. At the beginning
of every Magic game, your deck is shuffled. Some cards will tell you
to shuffle your library as part of their effect (usually because the
effect let you look through your library).</dd>
<dt id="term-sideboard">Sideboard</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Magic events allow the use of a sideboard—a group of extra cards
that are particularly good against certain opponents. After you play
a game against an opponent, you may make changes to your deck
using cards from your sideboard. You must reset your deck to its
original configuration before playing someone new.</p>
<p>In Constructed formats, your sideboard consists of up to 15
cards. Your combined deck and sideboard can’t have more than
four copies of any card other than basic land cards. Your deck
must have at least 60 cards.</p>
<p class="last">In Limited formats, all the cards you opened that aren’t in
your main deck are in your sideboard. Your deck must have at
least 40 cards.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-sorcery">Sorcery</dt>
<dd>A card type. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-sorcery"><span class="std std-ref">Sorcery</span></a> [on page 5].</dd>
<dt id="term-source">Source</dt>
<dd>Where damage or an ability came from. Once an ability has gone
on the stack, removing its source doesn’t stop the ability from
resolving.</dd>
<dt id="term-spell">Spell</dt>
<dd>All types of cards except lands are spells while you’re casting them.
For example, Serra Angel is a creature card. While you’re casting
it, it’s a creature spell. When it resolves, it becomes a creature.</dd>
<dt id="term-stack">Stack</dt>
<dd>A game zone. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-the-stack"><span class="std std-ref">The Stack</span></a> [on page 8].</dd>
<dt id="term-standard">Standard</dt>
<dd>The most popular Constructed format. It uses only the newest
sets the game has to offer. The current block, the block that was
released the previous October, and the most recent core set are all
legal to play in a Standard deck. See <a class="reference external" href="http://wizards.com/MagicFormats/">Wizards.com/MagicFormats</a>
for more information.</dd>
<dt id="term-static-ability">Static ability</dt>
<dd>One of the three types of abilities a permanent can have.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-static-abilities"><span class="std std-ref">Static Abilities</span></a> [on page 12].</dd>
<dt id="term-step">Step</dt>
<dd>Every phase except the main phase is divided into steps. Specific
things happen during some steps. For example, you untap your
permanents during your untap step. If a player has mana left over
as a step or phase ends, that mana is lost.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-parts-of-the-turn"><span class="std std-ref">Parts of the Turn</span></a> [on page 17].</dd>
<dt id="term-subtype">Subtype</dt>
<dd><p class="first">All types of cards can have subtypes. Subtypes come after the
long dash on the type line. Subtypes of creatures are also called
creature types, subtypes of lands are called land types, and so on.
A card can have multiple subtypes or none at all. For example, a
„Creature — Elf Warrior” has the subtypes Elf and Warrior, but
a card with just „Land” on its type line doesn’t have a subtype.</p>
<p>A few subtypes have special rules. See the glossary entries for
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-aura"><span class="xref std std-term">Aura</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#term-equipment"><span class="xref std std-term">Equipment</span></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-basic-land-type"><span class="xref std std-term">Basic land type</span></a>,
and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-planeswalker-type"><span class="xref std std-term">Planeswalker type</span></a>. Creature subtypes
don’t have any special rules associated with them.</p>
<p class="last">Some effects can change a permanent’s subtype. For example,
„Target creature becomes an Elf until end of turn.” The new
subtype replaces the previous subtypes of the appropriate kind,
unless the ability says otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-supertype">Supertype</dt>
<dd>All types of cards can have supertypes. Supertypes come before
the card type on the type line. For example, a „Basic Land —
Forest” has the supertype „basic,” and a „Legendary Creature
— Human Warrior” has the supertype „legendary.” Supertypes
have no specific correlation to card types. Some supertypes have
specific rules associated with them.</dd>
<dt id="term-swampwalk">Swampwalk</dt>
<dd>A kind of landwalk. See the glossary entry for <a class="reference internal" href="#term-landwalk"><span class="xref std std-term">Landwalk</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-tap">Tap</dt>
<dd>To turn a card sideways. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-tapping"><span class="std std-ref">Tapping</span></a> [on page 9].</dd>
<dt id="term-target">Target</dt>
<dd>A word used in spells and abilities. See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-target"><span class="std std-ref">Target</span></a> [on page 10].</dd>
<dt id="term-text-box">Text box</dt>
<dd>See <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-parts-of-a-card"><span class="std std-ref">Parts of a Card</span></a> [on page 5].</dd>
<dt id="term-token">Token</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Some instants, sorceries, and abilities can create creatures. These
creatures are represented by tokens. You can use anything you
want as a token, but you should use something that can be tapped.</p>
<p class="last">Tokens are considered creatures in every way, and they’re
affected by all the rules, spells, and abilities that affect creatures.
If one of your token creatures leaves the battlefield, however,
it moves to the new zone (such as your graveyard) and then
immediately vanishes from the game.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-toughness">Toughness</dt>
<dd>The number to the right of the slash in the box in the lower right
corner of creature cards. If a creature is dealt damage equal to
or greater than its toughness in a single turn, it’s destroyed. If a
creature’s toughness is reduced to 0 or less, it’s put into its owner’s
graveyard.</dd>
<dt id="term-trample">Trample</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures. Trample is an ability that
lets a creature deal excess damage to the player or planeswalker
it’s attacking even if it’s blocked. When a creature with trample is
blocked, you have to deal at least enough of its combat damage
to the creatures blocking it to destroy all those creatures. But if
each blocking creature is assigned damage at least equal to its
toughness, then you can assign any of the attacking creature’s
damage that’s left over to the player or planeswalker it’s attacking.</dd>
<dt id="term-triggered-ability">Triggered ability</dt>
<dd>One of the three types of abilities a permanent can have. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-triggered-abilities"><span class="std std-ref">Triggered Abilities</span></a> [on page 12].</dd>
<dt id="term-turn">Turn</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Each turn is divided into phases, and most phases have steps. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-parts-of-the-turn"><span class="std std-ref">Parts of the Turn</span></a> [on page 17].</p>
<p>Parts of the Turn:</p>

<dt id="term-vigilance">Vigilance</dt>
<dd>A keyword ability seen on creatures. When a creature with
vigilance attacks, it doesn’t become tapped.</dd>
<dt id="term-winning-the-game">Winning the game</dt>
<dd><p class="first">You win the game when any of the following things happens:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Your opponent’s life total is reduced to 0 or less.</li>
<li>Your opponent has to draw a card from an empty library.</li>
<li>Your opponent has ten or more poison counters. (No cards
in the Magic 2014 core set can give players poison counters.)</li>
<li>A spell or ability says that you win the game or your opponent
loses the game.</li>
<li>Your opponent concedes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both players would lose the game at the same time, the game is
draw—nobody wins.</p>
<p class="last">Different multiplayer variants may modify the conditions for
winning the game.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-x">X</dt>
<dd>When you see X in a mana cost or an activation cost, you get
to choose the number that X stands for. For example, Volcanic
Geyser is an instant spell that costs <img alt="{X}" src="_images/mana_x.png" /> <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> and deals X damage.
When you cast Volcanic Geyser, you choose what number X is.
If you pick three, for example, Volcanic Geyser costs <img alt="{3}" src="_images/mana_3.png" /> <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> and
deals 3 damage. If you pick six, Volcanic Geyser costs <img alt="{6}" src="_images/mana_6.png" /> <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> <img alt="{R}" src="_images/mana_r.png" /> and
deals 6 damage.</dd>
<dt id="term-you">You</dt>
<dd>The word „you” on a spell or ability refers to the current controller
of that spell or ability.</dd>
<dt id="term-zone">Zone</dt>

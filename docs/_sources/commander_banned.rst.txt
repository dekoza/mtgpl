Commander Banned List
=====================

The Commander cardpool consists of all regulation-sized Magic cards publicly released by Wizards of the Coast other than those with silver borders, gold borders or acorn-shaped security stamps. Cards are legal to play with as of their sets’ prerelease.

The following is the official banned list for commander games. These cards are not legal without prior agreement from the other players in the game, and may steer your playgroup to avoid other, similar cards. For the underlying philosophy that drives the banlist, see Format Philosophy.

* All cards that refer to the ante mechanic (full list here)
* All cards that Wizards has removed from constructed formats (full list here)
* All cards with the Conspiracy card type (full list here)

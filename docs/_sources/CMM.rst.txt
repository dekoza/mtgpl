   Search your library for a sorcery card, reveal it, then shuffle and put that card on top.


:mtgtip:`Selvala, Heart of the Wilds<https://cards.scryfall.io/border_crop/front/7/d/7d711cb2-4f34-4792-90d7-2be5d329a347.jpg?1684257293|https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/320/selvala-heart-of-the-wilds?utm_source=api>`
   Whenever another creature enters the battlefield, its controller may draw a card if its power is greater than each other creature's power.

   |mana_g|, |tap|: Add X mana in any combination of colors, where X is the greatest power among creatures you control.


:mtgtip:`The Ur-Dragon<https://cards.scryfall.io/border_crop/front/1/0/10d42b35-844f-4a64-9981-c6118d45e826.jpg?1676994966|https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/361/the-ur-dragon?utm_source=api>`
   Eminence — As long as The Ur-Dragon is in the command zone or on the battlefield, other Dragon spells you cast cost |mana_1| less to cast.

   Flying

   Whenever one or more Dragons you control attack, draw that many cards, then you may put a permanent card from your hand onto the battlefield.


:mtgtip:`Jeweled Lotus<https://cards.scryfall.io/border_crop/front/d/7/d7183700-6941-4a3d-a581-4f33bea795e9.jpg?1676994983|https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/396/jeweled-lotus?utm_source=api>`
   |tap|, Sacrifice Jeweled Lotus: Add three mana of any one color. Spend this mana only to cast your commander.


:mtgtip:`Zhulodok, Void Gorger<https://cards.scryfall.io/border_crop/front/a/0/a015461d-4214-4feb-8b04-519c537759eb.jpg?1683325160|https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/704/zhulodok-void-gorger?utm_source=api>`
   Colorless spells you cast from your hand with mana value 7 or greater have "Cascade, cascade." (When you cast one, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom of your library in a random order. Then do it again.)


:mtgtip:`Anikthea, Hand of Erebos<https://cards.scryfall.io/border_crop/front/8/b/8b796a56-1611-4835-ac5b-48b4e9263685.jpg?1683325229|https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/705/anikthea-hand-of-erebos?utm_source=api>`
   Menace

   Other enchantment creatures you control have menace.

   Whenever Anikthea enters the battlefield or attacks, exile up to one target non-Aura enchantment card from your graveyard. Create a token that's a copy of that card, except it's a 3/3 black Zombie creature in addition to its other types.


:mtgtip:`Commodore Guff<https://cards.scryfall.io/border_crop/front/9/2/92870fc6-a6bc-4198-bb31-397e07e0e835.jpg?1683366935|https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/706/commodore-guff?utm_source=api>`
   At the beginning of your end step, put a loyalty counter on another target planeswalker you control.

   +1: Create a 1/1 red Wizard creature token with "|tap|: Add |mana_r|. Spend this mana only to cast a planeswalker spell."

   −3: You draw X cards and Commodore Guff deals X damage to each opponent, where X is the number of planeswalkers you control.

   Commodore Guff can be your commander.


:mtgtip:`Sliver Gravemother<https://cards.scryfall.io/border_crop/front/9/f/9f5d253e-9eb2-423c-90ee-68f27ec6bf88.jpg?1683325555|https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/707/sliver-gravemother?utm_source=api>`
   The "legend rule" doesn't apply to Slivers you control.

   Each Sliver creature card in your graveyard has encore |mana_x|, where X is its mana value.

   Encore |mana_5| (|mana_5|, Exile this card from your graveyard: For each opponent, create a token copy that attacks that opponent this turn if able. They gain haste. Sacrifice them at the beginning of the next end step. Activate only as a sorcery.)

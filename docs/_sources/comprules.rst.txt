When the `triggerevent <#trigger_event>`__ occurs, the`ability <#ability>`__ checks whether the statedcondition is true.

If the `ability <#ability>`__`triggers <#trigger>`__, it checks the statedcondition again as it `resolves <#resolve>`__.If the condition isn't true at that time, the`ability <#ability>`__ is`removed <#remove_from_the_game_removed_removed-from-the-game_zone>`__from the `stack <#stack>`__ and does nothing.Note that this mirrors the check for legal`targets <#target>`__.

A`target <#target>`__ that's no longer in the`zone <#zone>`__ it was in when it was targetedis illegal. Other changes to the game state maycause a `target <#target>`__ to no longer belegal; for example, its`characteristics <#characteristics>`__ may havechanged or an `effect <#effect>`__ may havechanged the text of the `spell <#spell>`__.

Other parts of the`effect <#effect>`__ for which those`targets <#target>`__ are not illegal may stillaffect them. If the `spell <#spell>`__ or`ability <#ability>`__ `creates <#create>`__ any`continuous effects <#continuous_effect>`__ thataffect game rules (see rule`613.11 <#R61311>`__), those`effects <#effect>`__ don't apply to `illegaltargets <#illegal_target>`__.

.. rubric:: 722.1a. The rules for taking`shortcuts <#shortcut>`__ are largely informal.As long as each `player <#player>`__ in the gameunderstands the intent of each other`player <#player>`__, any`shortcut <#shortcut>`__ system they use isacceptable.

.. rubric:: 722.1b. Occasionally the game gets intoa state in which a set of actions could berepeated indefinitely (thus creating a"`loop <#loop>`__"). In that case, the`shortcut <#shortcut>`__ rules can be used todetermine how many times those actions arerepeated without having to actually performthem, and how the `loop <#loop>`__ is broken.

It can'tinclude conditional actions, where the outcomeof a game `event <#event>`__ determines the nextaction a `player <#player>`__ takes.

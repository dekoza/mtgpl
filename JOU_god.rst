.. Defeat a God Challenge Deck

===============
 Defeat a God!
===============

Xenagps has thrown all of Theros into disarray with his ascension to godhood.
His euphoric revels threaten to plunge the plane into chaos.
There is only one way to silence this revel once and for all: isolate Xenagos and vanquish him.

The party starts small, with only Xenagos and a few of his revelers, but that relative calm will not last for long.
More and more revelers will join as the battle continues.
They are violently erratic, attacking without warning one moment and pausing to celebrate the next.
Xenagos will even attack you directly when the mood strikes him.
As long as the revel continues and revelers surround him, he is untouchable.
But a god who loses all his followers is vulnerable.

Is your destiny a heroic victory or death at the hands of the divine?
Xenagos awaits.


**The "Defeat a God" Challenge uses the Regular Magic rules, with the following exceptions:**


Special Rules for the Player
============================

* You start with up to three different Hero cards on the battlefield. (You don't need a Hero to play.)
* You attack Xenagos Ascended and his Revelers directly with your creatures.
* You may target Xenagos as though he were a player.


Special Rules for Xenagos
=========================

* **Xenagos Ascended and two cards named Rollicking Throng begin the game on the battlefield.** Shuffle the rest of Xenagos's deck to begin the game.
* At the beginning of Xenagos's first main phase each turn, reveal the top two cards of Xenagos's library. Then Xenagos casts those cards.
* Xenagos Ascended and Reveler creatures don't attack unless a card specifically says they do.
* You make the choice if Xenagos needs to make a decision.
* Ignore effects that would cause Xenagos to draw or discard cards, or perform any impossible actions.
* If on of Xenagos's permanents would move to any zone other than its library or graveyard, that card is put into Xenagos's graveyard.


Winning the Challenge
=====================

**You win the game if Xenagos leaves the battlefield, which can happen only if there are no Revelers on the battlefield.**

You lose the game if you have 0 or less life or if you have to draw a card and your library is empty.

For a more difficult challenge, try beginning the game with three cards named Rollicking Throng on the battlefield.
For an easier challenge, try with only one.

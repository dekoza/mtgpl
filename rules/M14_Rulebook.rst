 Ignite Your Spark
===================

In the Magic™ game, you are counted among the elite spellcasters of the Multiverse — the Planeswalkers.
Some are friends and others are foes. All wield terrifying magic and command armies of creatures torn from the endless planes of reality.
Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.
Customize your own Magic deck, then challenge your friends to see whose spark burns the brightest!

Trading card games like the Magic: The Gathering® game combine collectable cards with a strategy game.
Start your collection with an intro pack and begin battling immediately with a ready-to-play deck.

Once you’ve gotten a handle on how to play, customize your deck using cards from booster packs, starting with the ones included in your intro pack.
You don’t know what cards you’ll get in a Magic booster pack. You just start a collection and trade with other players to get the cards you want.
You can find stores where Magic cards are sold at Wizards.com/Locator.

The best part about a trading card game is that it’s always changing. You design and build your own unique decks, and each Magic game you play is different.
New Magic expansions are released a few times a year, and each new expansion brings new ways to stupefy and defeat your opponents.

=======================
 Section 1: The Basics
=======================

The Magic: The Gathering game is a strategy game played by two or more players, each of whom has a customized deck of Magic cards.
Over the course of the game, each player will take turns playing cards such as lands (which enable you to play your other cards), creatures,
sorceries, and other spells. Each player starts at 20 life. When you reduce your opponent to 0 life by attacking with creatures and playing
spells, you win!

Five Colors of Mana
-------------------

Only one thing unites the infinite planes of the Multiverse: mana, the energy that fuels all magic. The five colors of mana are imbued
in the land itself, and a Planeswalker with a connection to a place can call upon its mana from across the sea of Æther between worlds.

Each color of mana fuels a different kind of powerful magic for you to command. For example, red spells have oR in their costs,
and tapping (turning) a Mountain gives you oR that you can spend to cast spells. It’s up to you whether to master one color or all five.

White
    White is the color of law, order, and structure. The sprawling Plains,
    populated by soldiers, clerics, and angels, provide white mana. You send
    coordinated armies of smaller creatures into battle to teach the enemy a lesson.
    
Green
    Green magic is about growth, life, and brute force. The Forests overflow with
    green mana, which represents the pulse of nature. You empower your creatures
    with the predatory might of nature and dominate through sheer size.

Blue
    Blue magic relies on trickery and manipulation. Islands provide blue
    mana, the color of the deep sea and the endless sky. You work behind the
    scenes, controlling your environment completely before making a move.

Red
    Red magic erupts with fire, frenzy, and storms of rock and lava. Red mana comes
    from Mountains and volcanoes. You act quickly and recklessly, channeling
    your wild emotions to summon mighty dragons or crush the ground your
    enemies walk on.

Black
    Black magic is about death, disease, and power at any cost. Black mana comes
    from dank Swamps, where things fester and rot. You are as selfish and twisted as
    the undead creatures and unspeakable horrors you command.




Parts of a Card
---------------

Card Name
    _


Mana Cost
    Mana is the main resource in the game. It’s produced by lands, and you spend it to cast spells.
    The symbols in a card’s upper right corner tell you the cost to cast that spell. If the mana cost reads
    {4}{R}{R}, you pay four mana of any kinds plus two red mana (from two Mountains) to cast it.

Type Line
    This tells you the card’s card type: artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land,
    planeswalker, or sorcery. If the card has a subtype or supertype, that’s also listed
    here. For example, Shivan Dragon is a creature, and its subtype is the creature                                                                                                                 28101
    type Dragon.

Expansion Symbol
    This symbol tells you which Magic set the card is from. This version of Shivan
    Dragon is from the Magic 2014 core set. The color of the symbol tells you the
    card’s rarity: black for common cards, silver for uncommons, gold for rares, and
    red-orange for mythic rares.

Text Box
    This is where a card’s abilities appear. You may also find flavor text printed in italics
    (like this) that tells you something about the Magic world. Flavor text has no effect
    on game play. Some abilities have italic reminder text to help explain what they do.

Power and Toughness
    Each creature card has a special box with its power and toughness. A creature’s power
    (the first number) is how much damage it deals in combat. Its toughness (the second number)
    is how much damage must be dealt to it in a single turn to destroy it. (A planeswalker
    card has a different special box with its loyalty here.)

Collector Number
    The collector number makes it easier to organize
    your cards. For example, “154/249” means that the
    card is the 154th of 249 cards in its set.


Card Types
----------

Every Magic card has one or more types. A card’s type tells you when you can play the card and what
happens to the card after you do.

Sorcery
    A sorcery represents a magical incantation. You can cast a sorcery only during
    a main phase of one of your own turns. You can’t cast it when another spell is
    on the stack. (You’ll learn about phases and the stack in a bit.) A sorcery has
    its effect—in other words, you follow the instructions on the card—then you put
    it into your graveyard, which is the game term for your discard pile.

Instant
    An instant is just like a sorcery, except you can cast it just about any time
    you want, even during your opponent’s turn or in response to another spell.
    Like a sorcery, an instant has its effect, then you put it into your graveyard.

Enchantment
    An enchantment represents a stable magical manifestation. An enchantment is
    a permanent. This means two things: you can cast one only at the time you
    could cast a sorcery, and after you cast one, you’ll put it on the table
    in front of you, near your lands. (Most players keep their lands closer to them,
    then put their other cards closer to the middle of the table.) The card is now
    on the battlefield. A card on the battlefield is called a permanent because it
    sticks around permanently (well, unless something destroys it).

    Some enchantments are Auras. An Aura enters the battlefield attached to
    a permanent and affects that permanent while it’s on the battlefield. If the
    enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield, the Aura is put into its owner’s
    graveyard.

Artifact
    An artifact represents a magical relic. Like an enchantment, an artifact is a permanent, so it’ll stay on the
    battlefield affecting the game. Most artifacts are colorless, so you can cast one no matter what kinds of lands
    you have.

    Some artifacts are Equipment. You can pay to attach an Equipment to a creature you control to make that
    creature more powerful. If an equipped creature leaves the battlefield, the Equipment doesn’t—the creature
    drops it and it remains on the battlefield.

Creature
    Creatures fight for you. They’re permanents, but unlike any other kind of permanent, creatures can attack
    and block. Each creature has power and toughness. Its power (the first number) is how much damage it deals
    in combat. Its toughness (the second number) is how much damage must be dealt to it in a single turn to
    destroy it. Creatures attack and block during the combat phase.

    Unlike other types of permanents, creatures enter the battlefield with “summoning sickness”: a creature
    can’t attack, or use an ability that has oT in its cost, until it has started your turn on the battlefield under
    your control. You can block with a creature or activate its other abilities no matter how long it’s been on
    the battlefield.

    Artifact creatures are both artifacts and creatures. They’re usually colorless like other artifacts, and they
    can attack and block like other creatures. An artifact creature can be affected by anything that affects
    artifacts, as well as anything that affects creatures.


Planeswalker
    Planeswalkers are powerful allies you can call on to fight by your side. You can cast a planeswalker only at the
    time you could cast a sorcery. They’re permanents, and each one enters the battlefield with the number of
    loyalty counters indicated in its lower right corner.

    Each planeswalker has loyalty abilities that are activated by adding or removing loyalty counters from the
    planeswalker. For example, the symbol {+1} means “Put one loyalty counter on this planeswalker” and the symbol
    {-3} means “Remove three loyalty counters from this planeswalker.” You can activate one of these abilities only
    at the time you could cast a sorcery and only if none of that planeswalker’s loyalty abilities have been activated
    yet that turn.

    Your planeswalkers can be attacked by your opponent’s creatures (if so, you can block as normal), and
    your opponents can damage them with their spells and abilities instead of damaging you. Any damage dealt
    to a planeswalker causes it to lose that many loyalty counters. If a planeswalker has no loyalty counters, it’s
    put into your graveyard.

Land
    Although lands are permanents, they aren’t cast as spells. To play a land, just put it onto the battlefield. This
    happens immediately, so no player can do anything else in response. You can play a land only during one
    of your main phases while the stack is empty. You can’t play more than one land a turn.

    Most lands have abilities that make mana. You’ll use lands to make the mana you need to pay for spells
    and abilities.

    Each basic land has a mana ability that makes one mana of a particular color. Plains make white mana
    ({W}), Islands make blue mana ({U}), Swamps make black mana ({B}), Mountains make red mana ({R}), and
    Forests make green mana ({G}). Any land other than these five is a nonbasic land.

  You respond to the Shock by casting Show of
2 Valor on your Auramancer. Show of Valor goes
  on the stack, on top of Shock.
  You and your opponent both decline to do

  Then the Shock resolves, dealing 2 damage

  enough to destroy it.

   What would happen if the Show of Valor were cast first?
   The Shock goes on the stack on top of
   Show of Valor so it resolves first. It deals 2
   damage to Auramancer—enough to destroy
   it! When the Show of Valor tries to resolve,
   its only target is no longer on the battlefield,
   so it’s countered (it does nothing).

They all attack at the same time, even if they’re attacking
different things. You can attack with a creature only if it’s
untapped, and only if it was on the battlefield under your
control when the turn began.
    Your opponent chooses which of his or her creatures will
block. Tapped creatures can’t be declared as blockers. For
blocking, it doesn’t matter how long the creature has been on
the battlefield. Each creature can block only one attacker,
but multiple blockers can gang up on a single attacking
creature. If that happens, the attacking player orders
the blockers to show which is first in line for
damage, which is second, and so on. Creatures
don’t have to block.
    After all blockers are chosen, combat damage
is assigned. Each creature—both attackers and
blockers—deals damage equal to its power.
  • An attacking creature that isn’t blocked
    deals damage to the player or planeswalker it’s
    attacking.
  • An attacking creature that is blocked deals damage to
    the blocking creatures. If one of your attacking creatures
    is blocked by multiple creatures, you decide how to divide
    its combat damage among them. You must assign at least
    enough damage to the first blocking creature in line to
    destroy it before you can assign damage to the next one
    in line, and so on.
  • A blocking creature deals damage to the attacker it’s
    blocking.

                                                  Building Your Own Deck
You play a Magic game with your own customized deck. You build it yourself using whichever Magic cards you want. There are two rules:
your deck must have at least 60 cards, and your deck can’t have more than four copies of any single card (except for basic lands). The rest
is up to you, but here are some guidelines:
        Lands. A good rule of thumb is that 40% of your deck should be lands. A 60-card deck usually has about 24 lands.
        Creatures. Creatures account for 15 to 25 cards in a typical 60-card deck. Choose creatures that have a variety of mana costs.
        Low-cost creatures are potent early on, but high-cost creatures can quickly win a game once they enter the battlefield.
        Other cards. Artifacts, enchantments, planeswalkers, instants, and sorceries round out your deck.
    After you play with your new deck for a while, you can start to customize it. Take out cards you don’t feel are working well and add new
cards you want to try. The best part about trading card games is being able to play with whatever cards you want, so start experimenting!
    Once they build up their collections, Magic players often choose to build different decks for different formats. Formats are defined by
what cards can be played in them. The most popular Magic format is called Standard. It uses only the newest sets the game has to offer. The
current block, the block that was released the previous October, and the most recent core set are all legal to play in a Standard deck. Standard
events are available all year, worldwide. When you’re ready to start exploring other Magic formats, go to Wizards.com/MagicFormats for
more information.
                                                         The Golden Rule
When a Magic card contradicts
the rulebook, the card wins. For
example, the rules say creatures
enter the battlefield untapped. But
Imposing Sovereign is a creature
that says “Creatures your opponents
control enter the battlefield tapped.”
Imposing Sovereign changes the
rules as long as it’s on the battlefield.
One of the things that makes the
Magic game fun to play is that there
are individual cards that let you break
almost every rule.

Now that you know the elements of the game and how to perform the main actions, it’s time to walk through a turn. This section
describes what happens in each part of a turn. In a typical game, you’ll skip many of these parts (for example, nothing usually
happens in the “beginning of combat” step). An actual Magic game is pretty casual, despite how complex the structure may seem.
                                                           Get a Deck
You’ll need your own Magic deck. You’ll also need a way to keep track of both players’ life totals, as well as small items to
use as counters or tokens.
   When you’re first getting started, you may want to pick up a ready-to-play deck, such as an intro pack or event deck, or
borrow a deck from a friend. After you’ve built up your collection, try building your own deck using the guidelines on page 15.
                                                          Get a Friend
To play a game, you’ll need an opponent! Your opponent will play against you using his or her own deck.

 Below are the parts of a turn. Each turn proceeds in the same sequence. Whenever you enter a new step or phase, any triggered abilities
 that happen during that step or phase trigger and are put on the stack. The active player (the player whose turn it is) gets to cast spells and
 activate abilities, then the other player does. When both players in a row decline to do anything and nothing is waiting to resolve, the game
 will move to the next step or phase.
    With each part of the turn is a description of what can happen during that part, if it’s your turn.

                                       Different Ways to Play
You know everything you need to play a Magic game. But what kind of game will you play? Appropriately enough for a game with so
many options, there are lots of different ways to play. Everyone can start on equal footing with brand-new cards rather than build decks
in advance from the cards in their collections. You can even play with a bunch of friends, not just one.
                                                        Limited Formats
In Limited play, each player builds his or her own deck on the spot out of a number of booster packs. In other words, your deck is made
from a limited card pool. Each deck must contain at least 40 cards (rather than the usual 60 for a Constructed deck). The only cards
you can play with are the ones opened in those packs, plus any number of basic land cards. (A 40-card deck should have about 17 lands
and about 15 creatures.)
Sealed Deck (any number of players)
In this Limited format, you build a deck out of brand-new booster packs. Each player opens six 15-card boosters and builds a 40-card
deck using the cards from his or her packs and any number of basic lands.
Booster Draft (4 to 8 players)
In this Limited format, instead of just opening your cards and building a deck, you and the other players at the table select (draft) the
cards for your decks. Each player at the table starts with three unopened 15-card booster packs.
   At the start of a booster draft, each player opens a pack and picks the card he or she wants from it. (You can’t see the cards that the
other players draft.) Then each player passes the rest of the pack to his or her left. You pick up the pack that was passed to you, select a
card, and pass the rest to your left. This process continues until all the cards have been drafted. Next, each player opens a second pack,
but this time, you pass the pack to your right. After all those cards are drafted, you open the third pack and pass to the left again. Use
your picks and any number of basic lands to build your 40-card deck.

                                                      Multiplayer Variants
You can play a Magic game with more than two players in it. There are dozens of different ways to do so. Some of the most popular are
Two-Headed Giant and Commander, which can be played using only traditional Magic cards from your collection. Other multiplayer
variants use oversized cards or a special die to provide a unique experience for your play group.

that commander and take advantage of his or her strengths. A
Commander game is best enjoyed as a Free-for-All game among
3–6 players, although two-player games are also common.

                         Tips
                         In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a mulligan, he or she draws a new hand
                         of seven cards rather than six cards. Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal.
                         In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first
                         turn. In all other multiplayer games, no player skips the draw step of his or her first turn.

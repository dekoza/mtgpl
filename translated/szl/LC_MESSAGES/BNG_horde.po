"As the battle progresses, more and more Minotaurs will join the ranks of the "
"Horde. They will attack at every opportunitym but a strong defense can turn "
"their aggression against them. The Horde will bring idols, talismans, and "
"other remnants of previous conquests. On the battlefield, these artifacts "
"will inspire the Horde to frenzy, speeding up the assault. But if you can "
"send those artifacts to the graveyard, you'll reap the rewards. The Horde's "
"sorceries make its creatures difficult to handle in combat, but these "
"sorceries can backfire at times."

"Xenagos has thrown all of Theros into disarray with his ascension to "
"godhood. His euphoric revels threaten to plunge the plane into chaos. There "

"The party starts small, with only Xenagos and a few of his revelers, but "
"that relative calm will not last for long. More and more revelers will join "

"warning one moment and pausing to celebrate the next. Xenagos will even "
"attack you directly when the mood strikes him. As long as the revel "
"continues and revelers surround him, he is untouchable. But a god who loses "
"all his followers is vulnerable."

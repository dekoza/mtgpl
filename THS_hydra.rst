.. Hydra Challenge Deck

=================
 Face the Hydra!
=================

Take the nest step on the Hero's Path and play a new form of **Magic: The Gathering.** Face this Challenge Deck as a single
hero or with a group. The deck's rules let you run the Hydra too!

How to Play
===========

You can battle the Hydra alone or with friends (just replace "you" with "each player" in these rules).
**At the end of any turn, if there are no Heads on the battlefield, you win!**

Use the regular **Magic** rules with the following exceptions:

* You start with up to two Hero cards on the battlefield. (You don't need a Hero to play.)
* Choose a starting number of Heads. Take that many **cards named Hydra Head** from the Challenge Deck and place them on the battlefield.
  Shuffle the remaining cards to form the Hydra's Library.
* You go first. (Don't draw a card on your first turn.)
* Then the Hydra takes its turn, and so on.
* You can attack Heads directly with your creatures. Any number of creatures can attack a single Head.
* **Growing New Heads:** Whenever a Head leaves the battlefield, reveal the top two cards of the Hydra's library. Put any
  Heads onto the battlefield and any sorcery cards into the Hydra's graveyard.

The Hydra's Turn
================

#. A the start of the Hydra's turn, untap any tapped Heads.
#. Reveal the top card of the Hydra's library. The Hydra casts that card.
   When the spell resolves, if it's a Head, put it onto the battlefield.
   If it's a sorcery, follow its instructions and then put it into the Hydra's
   graveyard.
#. The Hydra deals 1 damage to you for each untapped card named Hydra Head it controls
   and 2 damage to you for each untapped elite Head it controls.

Special Rules
-------------

* If the Hydra would be dealt damage or lose life, instead deal that much damage to a Head of your choice.
* Ignore effects that would cause the Hydra to draw or discard cards, or any impossible actions.
* If a Head would move to any zone other than the graveyard, instead put it into the Hydra's graveyard.
* You make any choices for the Hydra.
